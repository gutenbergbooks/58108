<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been suggested to me, that
<i>A brief and plain Exhibition of the utter Incongruity of the
peculiar doctrines of the Church of Rome with those both of the
Sacred Scriptures and of the early writers of the Christian
Church Catholic</i> might be useful as a small Tract for general
circulation.</p>
<p>This suggestion has given rise to the present little
manual.&nbsp; As for those, who either desire more copious
information on the subject, or who may wish to see my authorities
in the original Greek and Latin: I refer them to the second
edition of my <i>Difficulties of Romanism</i>, printed for
Messrs. Rivingtons, St. Paul&rsquo;s Church-Yard, and
Waterloo-Place, London, 1830.</p>
<p>If, from the Written Word of God and from the Fathers of the
three first ages, any Latin Divine can make out an historical
case, for <i>The alleged Apostolicity of the peculiarities of the
Church of Rome</i>, better than the failures of Mr. Berington and
Bishop Trevern of Strasbourg: let him by all means come forward,
whether he be Bishop or Priest or Deacon.&nbsp; The Bible and the
Fathers of the three first centuries, whence alone any historical
substantiation of the assertions made by the Romish Clergy can be
deduced, are open to them as well as to ourselves.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>Respecting <i>opinions in the abstract</i>, ingenious men
may dispute for ever: but <span class="GutSmall">FACTS</span> are
of a more stubborn and intractable quality.</p>
<p><i>Assertions</i> of the apostolicity and perpetuity and
immutability and primeval universality of Romish Peculiarities
are cheaply made: but <span class="GutSmall">FACTS</span> and
<span class="GutSmall">ASSERTIONS</span> are matters widely
different from each other.</p>
<p>To the satisfactory test of <span class="GutSmall">BARE
FACTS</span> I have brought the peculiar doctrines and practices
of Romanism.</p>
<p>Let the Latin Clergy, if it be in their power, set aside
<i>my</i> <span class="GutSmall">FACTS</span>, and historically
substantiate <i>their own</i> <span
class="GutSmall">ASSERTIONS</span>.</p>

<h2><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>CHAPTER
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> great and constant boast of the
Latin Clergy is: that <i>The Catholic or Universal Church of
Christ from the very beginning</i>, <i>has</i> <span
class="GutSmall">ALWAYS</span> <i>taught the doctrines which are
now taught by the Church of Rome</i>; that <i>These doctrines are
revealed to us in the Holy Scriptures</i>, and that <i>They
have</i> <span class="GutSmall">ALWAYS</span> <i>been set forth
and maintained by those early ecclesiastical writers who are
commonly styled the Fathers</i>.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; On these points lest we should labour under any
mistake, let us hear the positive declarations of the Council of
Trent, which sat in the sixteenth century, and which by the
Romanists is considered as having finally set at rest all
disputes respecting the points of doctrine litigated between
themselves and the Reformed. <a name="citation7"></a><a
href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>The
declarations of that last reputed infallible General Council run
in manner following.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; This faith was <span class="GutSmall">ALWAYS</span>
in <span class="GutSmall">THE CHURCH OF GOD</span>. <a
name="citation8a"></a><a href="#footnote8a"
class="citation">[8a]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The</span> <span
class="GutSmall">UNIVERSAL CHURCH</span> thus <span
class="GutSmall">ALWAYS</span> understood. <a
name="citation8b"></a><a href="#footnote8b"
class="citation">[8b]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; This matter was <span class="GutSmall">ALWAYS</span>
held for certain in <span class="GutSmall">THE CHURCH OF
GOD</span>. <a name="citation8c"></a><a href="#footnote8c"
class="citation">[8c]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The sacred scriptures</span>
declare, and the tradition of <span class="GutSmall">THE CATHOLIC
CHURCH</span> has <span class="GutSmall">ALWAYS</span> taught. <a
name="citation8d"></a><a href="#footnote8d"
class="citation">[8d]</a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Since, by the testimony of <span
class="GutSmall">SCRIPTURE</span>, by apostolical tradition, and
by the unanimous consent of <span class="GutSmall">THE
FATHERS</span>, the matter is perspicuous:&mdash;no one ought to
doubt. <a name="citation8e"></a><a href="#footnote8e"
class="citation">[8e]</a></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; The Council of Trent, following the testimonies of
<span class="GutSmall">THE SACRED SCRIPTURES</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">THE HOLY FATHERS</span> and the most esteemed
Councils and the judgment and consent of the Church herself,
determines, confesses, and declares, these doctrines. <a
name="citation8f"></a><a href="#footnote8f"
class="citation">[8f]</a></p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Here we have no ambiguity.&nbsp; The Church of Rome,
we see, speaking through the organ of the Council of Trent,
declares: that <i>Her doctrines are revealed in Holy
Scripture</i>; and that, <i>Expressly as such</i>, <i>they have
always been unanimously taught by the Fathers</i>, <i>and have
always been invariably received by the Church Universal</i>. <a
name="citation8g"></a><a href="#footnote8g"
class="citation">[8g]</a></p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>III.&nbsp; Now the meanest capacity will at once
perceive: that, <i>In making this declaration</i>, <i>the Church
of Rome asserts</i>, <i>not merely a point of opinion</i>,
<i>but</i> <span class="GutSmall">AN ABSOLUTE MATTER OF
FACT</span>.</p>
<p>The simple question, therefore, is: <i>Whether the
asserted</i> <span class="GutSmall">FACT</span> <i>be capable of
substantiation by competent</i> <span
class="GutSmall">EVIDENCE</span>.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In submitting this matter to the plain and honest
inquirer, it is obvious, that nothing more is necessary: than,
first, to state any particular doctrine of the Roman Church;
next, to bring forward either the silence or the declarations of
Scripture; and, lastly, to adduce the testimony of the
Fathers.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; By the adoption of such a plan, without a grain of
any extraordinary learning, and by the mere exercise of common
sense, every reader will be enabled fully to judge for
himself.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Nor can a member even of the Roman Church justly
refuse to hear me.&nbsp; For the present is simply <span
class="GutSmall">A QUESTION OF FACT</span>: and, by Mr.
Berington, one of his own Clergy, he is distinctly assured; that
<i>It is no article of Catholic Faith</i>, <i>that the Church
cannot err in</i> <span class="GutSmall">MATTERS OF FACT</span>.
<a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a> Under the express sanction, therefore,
of Mr. Berington, the laic gentlemen of the Roman Church will, I
hope, be persuaded to indulge me with their company.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TRANSUBSTANTIATION.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">SHALL</span> begin with subjecting,
to the test proposed by the Council of Trent itself, the doctrine
of Transubstantiation.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The following, as defined by the Council of Trent, is
the doctrine of the Roman Church with respect to the sacrament of
the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>1.&nbsp; <i>In the sacrament of the Eucharist</i>,
<i>after the consecration of the bread and wine</i>, <i>our Lord
Jesus Christ</i>, <i>true God and true man</i>, <i>is</i>,
<i>truly and really and substantially</i>, <i>contained</i>,
<i>under the species of those sensible objects</i>: <i>so
that</i>, <i>immediately after consecration</i>, <i>the true body
and the true blood of our Lord</i>, <i>together with his soul and
divinity</i>, <i>exist under the species of bread and wine</i>:
<i>for</i>, <i>by the very force of the words themselves</i>,
<i>the blood exists under the species of the wine</i>; <i>and the
body</i>, <i>under the species of the breed</i>.&nbsp;
<i>But</i>, <i>furthermore</i>, <i>by virtue of that natural
connection and concomitance</i>, <i>through which the parts of
the Lord</i>, <i>after his resurrection from the dead</i>, <i>are
mutually joined together</i>, <i>the body exists under the
species of the wine</i>, <i>the blood exists under the species of
the bread</i>, <i>and the soul exists under the species both of
the bread and the wine</i>.&nbsp; <i>The divinity</i>,
<i>moreover</i>, <i>on account of its admirable hypostatic union
with the body and the soul</i>, <i>similarly exists alike under
each species</i>.&nbsp; <i>Wherefore</i>, <i>under each species
and under both species</i>, <i>so much as even the whole is
contained</i>.&nbsp; <i>For the entire Christ exists both under
the species of bread</i>, <i>and under each particle of that
species</i>: <i>and the entire Christ exists</i>, <i>both under
the species of wine</i>, <i>and under all the particles of that
species</i>.&nbsp; <i>Hence</i>, <i>through the consecration of
the bread and wine</i>, <i>there takes place a conversion of the
whole substance of the bread into the substance of the body of
our Lord Christ</i>, <i>and of the whole substance of the wine
into the substance of his blood</i>: <i>which conversion is
properly and conveniently denominated Transubstantiation</i>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>All the faithful are bound to offer to the
Eucharist that same adoration of Latria</i>, <i>which is paid to
the Deity</i>: <i>for such adoration rests upon the belief</i>,
<i>that in that sacrament there is substantially present the
filial God</i>, <i>concerning whom the Father pronounced</i>;
<i>Let all the angels of God worship him</i>.&nbsp; <i>And</i>,
<i>analogously</i>, <i>in point of beneficial efficacy</i>,
<i>the Eucharist</i>, <i>being the identical sacrifice which
Christ </i><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span><i>offered upon the cross</i>, <i>must be deemed a true
propitiatory sacrifice</i>, <i>making satisfaction</i>, <i>each
time that it is offered</i>, <i>not only for the living</i>,
<i>but likewise for the dead in the Lord who have not as yet been
fully purified</i>. <a name="citation11a"></a><a
href="#footnote11a" class="citation">[11a]</a></p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Let us now hear Scripture with respect to this same
holy sacrament.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>I am the living bread</i>, <i>which came down from
heaven</i>.&nbsp; <i>If any man eat of this bread</i>, <i>he
shall live for ever</i>: <i>and the bread that I will give is my
flesh</i>, <i>which I will give for the life of the
world</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Jews</i>, <i>therefore</i>, <i>strove
among themselves</i>, <i>saying</i>: <i>How can this man give us
his flesh to eat</i>?&nbsp; <i>Then Jesus said unto them</i>:
<i>Verily</i>, <i>verily</i>, <i>I say unto you</i>; <i>Except ye
eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood</i>, <i>ye
have no life in you</i>.&nbsp; <i>Whoso eateth my flesh</i>,
<i>and drinketh my blood</i>, <i>hath eternal life</i>: <i>and I
will raise him up at the last day</i>.&nbsp; <i>For my flesh is
meat indeed</i>: <i>and my blood is drink indeed</i>.&nbsp;
<i>He</i>, <i>that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood</i>,
<i>dwelleth in me</i>, <i>and I in him</i>&mdash;<i>These sayings
said he in the synagogue</i>, <i>as he taught in
Capernaum</i>.&nbsp; <i>Many</i>, <i>therefore</i>, <i>of his
disciples</i>, <i>when they had heard this</i>, <i>said</i>:
<i>This is an hard saying</i>; <i>who can hear it</i>?&nbsp;
<i>When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at
it</i>, <i>he said unto them</i>: <i>Doth this offend
you</i>?&nbsp; <i>What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend
up where he was before</i>?&nbsp; <span class="GutSmall">IT IS
THE SPIRIT THAT QUICKENETH: THE FLESH PROFITETH NOTHING.&nbsp;
THE WORDS, THAT I SPEAK UNTO YOU, ARE SPIRIT AND LIFE.</span> <a
name="citation11b"></a><a href="#footnote11b"
class="citation">[11b]</a></p>
<p>When our Lord enforced the necessity of eating his flesh and
of drinking his blood, the Jews and even his disciples,
understanding him <i>literally</i> just as the Romish Clergy
<i>now</i> expound his language, murmured at so hard a saying,
and asked how he could possibly give men his flesh to eat.&nbsp;
Whereupon Christ, in the <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>avowed way of explanation,
immediately declared: that <i>the words</i>, <i>which he
spake</i>, <i>are spirit</i>; and that <i>the flesh profiteth
nothing</i>.&nbsp; Clearly, therefore, according to his own
distinct explanation, his words are to be understood
<i>spiritually</i> or <i>figuratively</i>, not <i>carnally</i> or
<i>literally</i>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>As they were eating</i>, <i>Jesus took bread</i>,
<i>and blessed</i>, <i>and brake</i>, <i>and gave to his
disciples</i>, <i>and said</i>: <i>Take</i>, <i>eat</i>; <i>this
is my body</i>.&nbsp; <i>And he took the cup</i>, <i>and gave
thanks</i>, <i>and gave to them</i>, <i>saying</i>: <i>Drink ye
all of it</i>; <i>for this is my blood of the New Testament</i>,
<i>which is shed for many for the remission of sins</i>.&nbsp;
<i>But I say unto you</i>: <i>I will not drink henceforth of</i>
<span class="GutSmall">THIS FRUIT OF THE VINE</span>, <i>until
that day when I drink it new with you in my Father&rsquo;s
kingdom</i>. <a name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a></p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The authoritative interpretation of such language,
as that which is here employed by our Lord, had already been
given by him at Capernaum.&nbsp; His words are to be understood
<i>spiritually</i> or <i>figuratively</i>: just as when he
declared himself to be a <i>vine</i> and his disciples to be
<i>branches</i>. <a name="citation12b"></a><a href="#footnote12b"
class="citation">[12b]</a></p>
<p>Accordingly, even <i>after</i> consecration, when the Romish
Clergy assert the wine to have been literally transubstantiated
into the actual material blood of Christ; he himself still calls
it <i>this fruit of the vine</i>: an appellation, if we receive
as scriptural truth the doctrine of Transubstantiation,
<i>then</i> clearly false and erroneous and inaccurate.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; We may note, that the Apostles expressed not the
least surprise, or uttered the smallest murmur, on account of our
Lord&rsquo;s phraseology, when he instituted the sacrament of the
Eucharist.</p>
<p>The reason is obvious, though the fact is highly worth our
special attention.&nbsp; They had heard and recollected his own
explanation of the parallel language which he employed at
Capernaum.&nbsp; Hence they <i>now</i>, as a matter of course,
understood him to <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>speak <i>figuratively</i>, not <i>literally</i>: and
hence, what was the natural result, his words <i>now</i> gave
them <span class="GutSmall">NO</span> offence.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>I have received of the Lord that which also I
delivered unto you</i>: <i>that The Lord Jesus</i>, <i>the night
in which he was betrayed</i>, <i>took bread</i>: <i>and</i>,
<i>when he had given thanks</i>, <i>he brake</i>, <i>and

<i>when he had supped</i>, <i>saying</i>: <i>This cup is the New
Testament in my blood</i>: <i>this do ye as oft as ye drink</i>,
<i>in remembrance of me</i>.&nbsp; <i>For</i>, <i>as often as ye
eat</i> <span class="GutSmall">THIS BREAD</span> <i>and drink</i>
<span class="GutSmall">THIS CUP</span>, <i>ye do shew the
Lord&rsquo;s death till he come</i>.&nbsp; <i>Wherefore</i>,
<i>whosoever shall eat</i> <span class="GutSmall">THIS
BREAD</span> <i>and drink</i> <span class="GutSmall">THIS
CUP</span> <i>of the Lord unworthily</i>, <i>shall be guilty of
the body and blood of the Lord</i>.&nbsp; <i>But let a man
examine himself</i>: <i>and so let him eat of</i> <span
class="GutSmall">THE BREAD</span>, <i>and drink of</i> <span
class="GutSmall">THE CUP</span>. <a name="citation13a"></a><a
href="#footnote13a" class="citation">[13a]</a></p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The language of St. Paul exactly corresponds with
the language of Christ.</p>
<p>Even after consecration, the Apostle, we may observe, still
repeatedly calls the elements <i>this bread</i> and <i>this
cup</i> or <i>the bread</i> and <i>the cup</i>.&nbsp; Yet he
could not <i>truly</i> have thus called them: if, all the while,
they had become, by transubstantiation, literal human flesh and
literal human blood.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; We may here again note, that the <i>true</i>
doctrine of the Eucharist, as undoubtedly delivered by St. Paul
to the gentile converts of Corinth, does not appear to have
excited either surprise or offence.</p>
<p>Whence the presumption, or rather indeed the certainty, is:
that, in delivering it to them, he distinctly taught, on the
authority of his Lord and Master, that <i>it is the spirit which
quickeneth</i>, that <i>the flesh profiteth nothing</i>, and that
<i>the words spoken by Christ are spirit and life</i>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; As our Saviour thus fully explains his own <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>phraseology:
so, in strict congruity with his explanation; on the existence,
of the soul and divinity of Christ in the consecrated elements,
and on the adoration of those elements with the very same
adoration as that which is paid to the Deity, Holy Scripture is
<span class="GutSmall">PROFOUNDLY SILENT</span>.</p>
<p>From whatever quarter the duty of such worship was learned by
the Romish Priesthood, it assuredly was <i>not</i> learned from
the Bible.&nbsp; The written word of God neither enjoins it, nor
gives a single instance of its ever having being paid either in
the time or with the sanction of the Apostles.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Equally silent</span> also is the
Bible, respecting the alleged circumstance: that <i>The
celebration of the Eucharist is a true propitiatory sacrifice
both for the quick and for the dead</i>.</p>
<p>The Church of Rome, indeed, teaches this doctrine: but she did
<i>not</i> learn it from Scripture.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; We may now, with advantage, proceed to hear the
declarations of the Fathers concerning the sacrament of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Clement of Alexandria lived in the second
century.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The Scripture has named wine <span
class="GutSmall">A MYSTIC SYMBOL</span> of the holy blood. <a
name="citation14a"></a><a href="#footnote14a"
class="citation">[14a]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Know well, that the Lord himself also partook of
<span class="GutSmall">WINE</span>: for he himself also was a
man.&nbsp; And he blessed the wine, saying: <i>Take</i>,
<i>drink</i>; <i>this is my blood</i>, <i>the blood of the
vine</i>.&nbsp; The holy stream of exhilaration <span
class="GutSmall">ALLEGORICALLY REPRESENTS</span> the Word, who
poured himself out on behalf of many, for the remission of sins.
<a name="citation14b"></a><a href="#footnote14b"
class="citation">[14b]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Tertullian flourished at the end of the second and at
the beginning of the third century.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; We must not call our senses in question, lest we
should doubt respecting their fidelity even in the case of Christ
himself.&nbsp; For, if we question their <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>fidelity, we
might be led to say: that Christ&mdash;<span
class="GutSmall">TASTED A DIFFERENT FLAVOUR OF THE WINE WHICH HE
CONSECRATED IN MEMORY OF HIS OWN BLOOD</span>. <a
name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; If Christ declares, that <i>The</i> <span
class="GutSmall">FLESH</span> <i>profiteth nothing</i>; the sense
must be decided from the matter of the saying.&nbsp; For, because
the Jews deemed his discourse hard and intolerable, as if he had
truly determined that his <span class="GutSmall">FLESH</span> was
to be eaten by them: in order that he might dispose the state of
salvation <span class="GutSmall">TOWARD THE SPIRIT</span>, he
promised; <i>It is the</i> <span class="GutSmall">SPIRIT</span>
<i>that quickeneth</i>.&nbsp; And thus he subjoined: <i>The</i>
<span class="GutSmall">FLESH</span> <i>profiteth nothing</i>,
namely, to quicken.&nbsp; There follows also, <span
class="GutSmall">WHAT HE WOULD HAVE US UNDERSTAND BY
SPIRIT</span>.&nbsp; <i>The words</i>, <i>which I have spoken
unto you</i>, <i>are spirit and life</i>. <a
name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a></p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; Christ reprobated, neither the water of the Creator
with which he washes his people, nor the oil with which he
anoints them, nor the fellowship of honey and milk with which he
feeds them as infants, nor the <span
class="GutSmall">BREAD</span> by which he <span
class="GutSmall">REPRESENTS</span> his own body: for, even in his
sacraments, he needs the beggarly elements of the Creator. <a
name="citation15c"></a><a href="#footnote15c"
class="citation">[15c]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Athanasius flourished in the fourth century.</p>
<p>When our Lord conversed on the eating of his body, and when he
thence beheld many scandalised, he forthwith added: <i>Doth this
offend you</i>?&nbsp; <i>What if ye shall behold the Son of man
ascending where he was before</i>?&nbsp; <i>It is the spirit that
quickeneth</i>: <i>the flesh profiteth nothing</i>.&nbsp; <i>The
words</i>, <i>which I speak unto you</i>, <i>are spirit and
life</i>.&nbsp; Both these matters, <span class="GutSmall">THE
FLESH</span> and <span class="GutSmall">THE SPIRIT</span>, he
said respecting himself.&nbsp; And he distinguished the spirit
from the flesh: <span class="GutSmall">IN ORDER THAT</span>,
<span class="GutSmall">BELIEVING BOTH THE VISIBLE AND THE
INVISIBLE</span>, <span class="GutSmall">THEY MIGHT UNDERSTAND
HIS SAYINGS TO BE NOT CARNAL BUT SPIRITUAL</span>.&nbsp; For
<span class="GutSmall">TO HOW MANY PERSONS COULD HIS BODY HAVE
SUFFICED </span><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span><span class="GutSmall">FOR FOOD</span>: <span
class="GutSmall">SO THAT IT MIGHT BECOME THE ALIMENT OF THE WHOLE
WORLD</span>?&nbsp; But, that he might divert their minds from
carnal cogitations, and that they might learn the flesh which he
would give them to be supercelestial and spiritual food: he, on
this account, mentioned the ascent of the Son of man to
heaven.&nbsp; <i>The words</i>, said he, <i>which I speak unto
you</i>, <i>are spirit and life</i>.&nbsp; As if he had
intimated: My body shall be exhibited and given as food for the
world; so <span class="GutSmall">THAT THAT FOOD SHALL BE GIVEN TO
EACH ONE SPIRITUALLY</span>, and shall to all be a preservative
to the resurrection unto life eternal. <a

<p>4.&nbsp; Eusebius of Cesar&egrave;a lived in the fourth
century.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Christ himself gave the <span
class="GutSmall">SYMBOLS</span> of the divine economy to his own
disciples; commanding, that the <span
class="GutSmall">IMAGE</span> of his own body should be made. <a
name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b"
class="citation">[16b]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; He delivered to us, that we should use the bread as
the <span class="GutSmall">SYMBOL</span> of his own body. <a

class="citation">[16c]</a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Ambrose lived in the fourth century.</p>
<p>In the Law, was the shadow: in the Gospel, is the <span
class="GutSmall">IMAGE</span>: in heaven, is the <span
class="GutSmall">REALITY</span>.&nbsp; Formerly, a lamb was
offered, a calf was offered: now, Christ is offered&mdash;Here,
he is in an <span class="GutSmall">IMAGE</span>: there, he is in
<span class="GutSmall">REALITY</span>. <a

<p>6.&nbsp; Macarius the Egyptian lived in the fourth
century.</p>
<p>In the Church are offered bread and wine, the <span
class="GutSmall">ANTITYPE</span> of Christ&rsquo;s flesh and
blood: and they, who partake of the visible bread, eat the flesh
of the Lord <span class="GutSmall">SPIRITUALLY</span>. <a
name="citation16e"></a><a href="#footnote16e"
class="citation">[16e]</a></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Gregory of Nyssa lived in the fourth century.</p>
<p>Since this holy altar, at which we stand, is in its nature
only a common stone, differing nothing from those other flat
tablets, which are built into our walls or which ornament our
pavements; but, when it has <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>been dedicated to the service of God
and has received the benediction, it is a holy table, an
unpolluted altar, no longer indiscriminately handled by all, but
touched only by the priests and even by them with pious caution:
and, again, since the bread is originally mere common bread; but,
when the mystery shall have wrought its sanctification, it is
both called and is the body of Christ: <span
class="GutSmall">THUS</span> the mystic oil, <span
class="GutSmall">THUS</span> the wine, though of small value
before the benediction, respectively operate with mighty power
after sanctification by the Spirit.&nbsp; The <span
class="GutSmall">SAME</span> potency of the word, moreover,
effects a venerable and honourable priest: when, through the
newness of the benediction, the individual is separated from
common fellowship with the many.&nbsp; For, only yesterday and
the day before, he was nothing more than one out of the many,
nothing more than one of the laity: but now he is set forth, as a
leader, as a precessor, as a teacher of piety, as a heirophant of
the hidden mysteries.&nbsp; And these things he does, not at all
changed in body or in form: but he does them; being, in outward
appearance, the same person that he was before; though, in his
invisible soul, through a certain invisible power and grace,
being transmuted into a better condition. <a

<p>8.&nbsp; Cyril of Jerusalem lived in the fourth century.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; While eating, the communicants are commanded to
eat, not bread and wine, but the <span
class="GutSmall">ANTITYPE</span> of the body and blood of Christ.
<a name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; As <span class="GutSmall">ALSO</span> the bread of
the Eucharist, after the invocation of the Holy Spirit, is no
longer bare bread, but the body of Christ: so <span
class="GutSmall">LIKEWISE</span>, after the invocation, this holy
ointment (the ointment or chrism formerly used in the rite of
Confirmation) is no longer mere ointment, nor as one may say
common ointment. <a name="citation17c"></a><a href="#footnote17c"

<p>9.&nbsp; Augustine flourished in the fourth and fifth
centuries.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>(1.)&nbsp; The Lord, when he gave the <span

<p>(2.)&nbsp; These are sacraments, in which, not <i>what they

is the spirit that quickeneth</i>; <i>the flesh profiteth
nothing</i>.&nbsp; <i>The words</i>, <i>which I speak unto
you</i>, <i>are spirit and life</i>.&nbsp; As if he had said:

<p>(4.)&nbsp; In the interpretation of figurative passages, let
the following canon be observed.&mdash;</p>
<p>If the passage be preceptive, either forbidding some
flagitious deed and some heinous crime, or commanding something
useful and beneficent: then such passage is <span
class="GutSmall">NOT FIGURATIVE</span>.&nbsp; But, if the passage
seems, either to command some flagitious deed and some heinous
crime, or to forbid something useful and beneficent: then such
passage is <span class="GutSmall">FIGURATIVE</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, for example, Christ says: <i>Unless ye shall eat the
flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood</i>, <i>ye shall have
no life in you</i>.</p>
<p>Now, in these words, he seems to command a heinous crime or a
flagitious deed.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Therefore this passage
is a figure</span>. <a name="citation18d"></a><a

they, who partake of the divine mysteries, should not attend to
the nature of the things which they see; but that, in the change
of names, they should believe that change which is wrought by
grace: inasmuch as he, who called his own natural body
<i>wheat</i> and <i>bread</i>, and who further bestowed upon
himself the appellation of <i>a vine</i>, honoured also the
viable <span class="GutSmall">SYMBOLS</span> with the name of his

<p><span class="smcap">Therefore they are not me same</span>. <a

class="citation">[22]</a></p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; The plain inquirer will now judge for himself:
whether the romish doctrine of Transubstantiation, with the
associated practice of adoring as God the consecrated elements,
be taught either in Scripture, or by the early Fathers.</p>
<p>As for Scripture, sufficient has already been said: and, with
respect to the evidence afforded by the ancient Doctors of the
Catholic Church, those Doctors, we see, protest <i>against</i>
any such new-fangled notions, not only during the three first
centuries, but down even to the ninth century; and they protest,
moreover, in every possible way that could well have been either
required or imagined.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; According to <i>their</i> interpretation of
Scripture, which manifestly was the interpretation received as
orthodox by the universal Church at the times when they
respectively flourished, we have the following very distinct and
very important results.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The consecrated elements are <span
class="GutSmall">IMAGES</span> or <span
class="GutSmall">SYMBOLS</span> or <span
class="GutSmall">TYPES</span> or <span
class="GutSmall">SIGNS</span> or <span
class="GutSmall">REPRESENTATIONS</span> of the body and blood of
Christ.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Communicants do <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span>
partake of that <i>literal</i> body and blood, in which the Lord
suffered and which he shed on the cross.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; The symbols of bread and wine, <span
class="GutSmall">AFTER</span> consecration, <span
class="GutSmall">STILL REMAIN UNCHANGED IN THEIR ORIGINAL
SUBSTANCE</span>: and, consequently, they are <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span> transubstantiated.</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; Christ called the bread and wine <i>his body and
blood</i>, <span class="GutSmall">IN THE SAME SENSE</span> and
<span class="GutSmall">ON THE SAME PRINCIPLE</span> that he
called himself <i>a vine</i>.</p>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; When the early writers style the bread and <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>wine <i>the
body and blood of Christ</i>; or when they say, that <i>the bread
and wine are the body and blood of Christ</i>; or when they
affirm, that <i>the bread and wine are changed into the body and
blood of Christ</i>: they themselves state, by way of
explanation, that they only speak metonymically and
figuratively.&nbsp; For they distinctly tell us: that they are
wont to call the bread and wine <i>Christ&rsquo;s body and
blood</i>; <span class="GutSmall">NOT BECAUSE THE BREAD IS
PROPERLY HIS BODY</span>, <span class="GutSmall">OR BECAUSE THE
WINE IS PROPERLY HIS BLOOD</span>; but only because they contain
the sacrament of his body and blood within themselves, or because
the <span class="GutSmall">IMAGE</span> and <span
class="GutSmall">SIMILITUDE</span> of his body and blood are
exhibited in the due celebration of the Eucharist.</p>
<p>(6.)&nbsp; Hence, in strict consistency, the <i>sole</i>
change in the elements, produced by consecration, is said, by the
same early writers, to be a <span class="GutSmall">MORAL</span>
and not a <span class="GutSmall">PHYSICAL</span> change.&nbsp;
For they pronounce it to be such a change, as is produced in the
confirmatory chrism or in the stone of an altar-table or in the
baptismal water; when, by consecration, they cease to be secular,
and are devoted to sacred purposes: and, even yet more
remarkably, they pronounce it to be such a change, as is produced
in a man; when, by ordination, he ceases to be a laic, and
becomes a clerk.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Nor do we thus find, in the old Doctors of the
Church, a mere simple <i>anticipatory</i> protest against the
modern Romish dogma, of Transubstantiation: we may note also, in
the case of Raban and Bertram, a formal direct
<i>synchranical</i> protest against the wild notion of
<i>Christ&rsquo;s</i> <span class="GutSmall">CORPOREAL</span> or
<span class="GutSmall">LITERAL</span> or <span
class="GutSmall">SUBSTANTIAL</span> <i>presence in the
Eucharist</i>, when, in the ninth century, and under the
fostering management of Paschase Radbert, it was attempting to
creep into the hitherto untainted Western Churches.</p>
<p>No sooner was the idle phantasy started; that <i>The identical
body and blood of Christ</i>, <i>in which he was born from the
Virgin Mary</i>, <i>is literally and substantially received from
the altar</i>: than it was distinctly <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>and openly opposed, on the specific
ground, not only of <i>its abstract scriptural falsehood</i>, but
likewise of <i>its palpable novelty</i> and <i>its then scanty
reception</i>.&nbsp; For all these three points are clearly set
forth by Archbishop Raban in his three very remarkable
expressions, <span class="GutSmall">LATELY</span>, and <span
class="GutSmall">SOME INDIVIDUALS</span>, and <span
class="GutSmall">NOT THINKING RIGHTLY</span>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PURGATORY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the Romish doctrine of
Transubstantiation, I shall pass on to the Romish doctrine of
Purgatory.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Respecting a Purgatory, into which the souls of all,
save those who are immediately conveyed to Hell, pass forthwith
after death; in order that, by its fiery pains, they may be
purified from the remainder of their corruption, and at the same
time by personal suffering may make satisfaction to God for their
hitherto unexpiated offences: the Church of Rome, speaking
through her organ the Council of Trent, thus defines and
pronounces.</p>
<p><i>There is a Purgatory</i>: <i>and the souls</i>, <i>there
detained</i>, <i>are assisted by the suffrages of the faithful
and most especially by the acceptable sacrifice of the altar</i>.
<a name="citation24"></a><a href="#footnote24"
class="citation">[24]</a></p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Such is the authorised doctrine of the Roman Church:
let us now see, whether the existence of a Purgatory in the
unseen world be revealed in Scripture.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; On this point, we may begin with very safely
remarking: that, from the first verse of Genesis to the last
verse of the Revelation, God&rsquo;s written word, whether jewish
or christian, <span class="GutSmall">SAYS NOT A SINGLE
SYLLABLE</span> concerning the existence of any such place as a
romish Purgatory.</p>
<p>Whence, of course, it is <span class="GutSmall">EQUALLY
SILENT</span>, respecting <a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>the extraordinary alleged fact: that,
<i>Souls</i>, <i>there detained</i>, <i>are assisted by the
suffrages or prayers of the faithful and most especially by the
acceptable sacrifice of the altar</i>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But Holy Scripture is not merely <span
class="GutSmall">SILENT</span> on this subject: by anticipation,
it even <span class="GutSmall">FLATLY CONTRADICTS</span> the
popish doctrine before us.</p>
<p><i>I heard a voice from heaven</i>, <i>saying unto me</i>:
<i>Write</i>; <i>Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from
henceforth</i>: <i>Yea</i>, <i>saith the Spirit</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">THAT THEY MAY REST FROM THEIR LABOURS</span>;
<i>and their works do follow them</i>. <a
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a></p>
<p>If, as the Romish Clergy teach, even those, who die in the
Lord, pass into Purgatory, where they suffer pains equal to those
of Hell in intensity and inferior to them only in duration:
certainly, such souls can with no truth be said henceforth to
rest from their labours.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; In reality, the very notion of a Purgatory stands
irreconcileably opposed to the whole scheme and analogy of
Scripture.</p>
<p>For the doctrine of a Purgatory holds out the speculation:
that, <i>By penal suffering</i>, <i>we both may be purified from
our sins</i>, <i>and likewise may make personal meritorious
satisfaction to God for them</i>.</p>
<p>Whereas Scripture teaches us: that <i>We are justified from
our sins by the sole merits of the Son</i>, and that <i>We are
sanctified from our pollutions by the exclusive ordinary
operation of the Spirit</i>.</p>
<p>On the present point, then, are we to believe the Bible, or
the Council of Trent and the Latin Priesthood?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Finding it impossible to establish the existence of a
Purgatory from the genuine written word of God, the Romish Clergy
attempt to substantiate it from a text in the Apocrypha.</p>
<p><i>When Judas had made a gathering throughout the </i><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span><i>company to
the sum of two thousand drachms of silver</i>, <i>he sent it to
Jerusalem</i>, <i>to offer a sin-offering</i>; <i>doing therein
well and honestly</i>, <i>in that he was mindful of the
resurrection</i> (<i>for</i>, <i>if he had not hoped that they
that were slain should have risen again</i>, <i>it had been
superfluous and vain to pray for the dead</i>), <i>and also in
that he perceived that there was great favour laid up for those
that died godly</i>.&nbsp; <i>It was a holy and good
thought</i>.&nbsp; <i>Whereupon</i>, <i>he made a reconciliation
for the dead</i>, <i>that they might be delivered from sin</i>.
<a name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a></p>
<p>Now this text, even if we could admit the canonical authority
of a book which <i>praises self-murder</i>, and which
<i>apologises for its own defects</i>, <a
name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a> would stand the Latin Priesthood in
small stead: for <i>it never once mentions any Purgatory</i>; and
the persons, moreover, for whom Judas attempted to make
reconciliation, were actually men who had died <i>in the mortal
sin of idolatry unrepented of</i>, and consequently were men who
(by the determination of the Council of Trent) had passed not
into Purgatory but into Hell. <a name="citation26c"></a><a
href="#footnote26c" class="citation">[26c]</a></p>
<p>In truth, however, for the too evident purpose of serving a
turn, the doctors of the Council of Trent, in defiance of the
universal testimony of the early Church as expressed most
distinctly by Melito and Cyril and Ruffinus and Jerome and
Epiphanius and Athanasius, have foisted into the genuine canon of
inspired Scripture, those mere unauthoritative human
compositions, which are commonly styled <i>apocryphal</i>, and
for the simple quoting of which about the close of the sixth
century, Pope Gregory the great absolutely makes a regular formal
apology. <a name="citation26d"></a><a href="#footnote26d"
class="citation">[26d]</a></p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>As one
out of our many witnesses against these daring innovators, let us
hear, from the fourth century, the venerable Cyril of Jerusalem,
while officially instructing his Catechumens in order to their
baptism.</p>
<p><i>Read the twenty and two books contained in the Old
Testament</i>: <i>but</i> <span class="GutSmall">WITH THE
APOCRYPHA HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON</span>.&nbsp; <i>Study
diligently those twenty and two books</i> <span
class="GutSmall">ALONE</span>, <i>which also with confidence are
read in the Church</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Apostles and the ancient
Bishops</i>, <i>who delivered those books to us</i>, <i>were much
wiser than you</i>.&nbsp; <i>As children of the Church</i>,
<i>therefore</i>, <i>set not upon her authorised documents the
adulterating seal of a false impression</i>. <a
name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a></p>
<p>This <i>adulterating seal of a false impression</i>, so
strongly reprobated by Cyril in the fourth century, was, in the
sixteenth century, employed, without the least scruple, for the
impious corruption of God&rsquo;s written word, by the Romish
Clergy at the Council of Trent.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; From Scripture, let us proceed to the early Fathers
of the Church.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; In the way of <i>negative</i> evidence, Polycarp the
disciple of St. John, Athenagoras, and Iren&egrave;us, who
collectively flourished during a period which extends from the
latter end of the first to the latter end of the second century,
are <span class="GutSmall">TOTALLY SILENT</span> respecting the
existence of a Purgatory; even when the nature of their subject
is such, that, had they been acquainted with the doctrine, they
<i>must</i> have mentioned it. <a name="citation27b"></a><a
href="#footnote27b" class="citation">[27b]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; In the way of <i>positive</i> evidence, Clement of
Rome the disciple and fellow-labourer of St. Paul, <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>Ignatius the
disciple of St. John, Justin Martyr, Hippolytus, and Cyprian, who
collectively flourished during a period which extends from the
year 63 to the year 258, either by anticipation <span
class="GutSmall">EXPRESSLY CONTRADICT</span>, or else use
language <span class="GutSmall">PALPABLY INCOMPATIBLE
WITH</span>, the doctrine of a Purgatory. <a
name="citation28a"></a><a href="#footnote28a"
class="citation">[28a]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; When this doctrine began to creep into the Church,
the individuals, who started it, could not agree among
themselves, either as to <i>its nature</i>, or as to <i>its
certainty</i>, or as to <i>its chronological location</i>: and,
what is sufficiently whimsical, not one among them agreed with
the present Church of Rome. <a name="citation28b"></a><a
href="#footnote28b" class="citation">[28b]</a></p>
<p>Now, if the doctrine of a Purgatory had been <i>uniformly</i>
and <i>universally</i> and <i>constantly</i> held in the Church
Catholic from the very beginning, as the Romish Clergy would
persuade us: it is quite clear, that this curious discrepance
could never have occurred.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; At <i>present</i>, the members of the Latin Church
pray for the dead, <i>with the avowed object that their souls may
be delivered from Purgatory</i>: but, when prayers for the dead
<i>first</i> came into use, those prayers were offered up <i>with
no such purpose and intention</i>.</p>
<p>Let it be known and observed (for many are ignorant of the
circumstance): that, at the commencement of the practice,
supplication was made, not <i>that souls might be delivered from
Purgatory</i>, but <i>that they might be partakers of the first
resurrection</i>: <a name="citation28c"></a><a
href="#footnote28c" class="citation">[28c]</a> and the notion
itself evidently originated from <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>a gratuitous interpretation of a well
known obscure text in the Apocalypse. <a
name="citation29a"></a><a href="#footnote29a"
class="citation">[29a]</a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The unauthorised practice of praying for the dead,
under <i>any</i> aspect, being thus plainly a mere innovation
upon the primitive simplicity of the Gospel; its utility, as we
learn from Cyril of Jerusalem, was questioned by <span
class="GutSmall">MANY</span>, even so late as the middle of the
fourth century.&nbsp; Finding not a vestige of the thing in the
whole Bible, and naturally judging that we can know nothing about
the matter save from a distinct revelation, they very sensibly
asked: <i>How is the soul benefited by any such mention of
it</i>, <i>whether it depart from this world with sin or without
sin</i>? <a name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b"
class="citation">[29b]</a></p>
<p>It were well, if the Romish Clergy, when they boast of the
immutability of their doctrine and practice, would account of
these odd variations.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Meanwhile, let the sober inquirer judge for himself,
whether there be even a shadow for the idle plea: that the
doctrine of Purgatory is revealed in the Bible, and that it was
maintained from the beginning by all the early Fathers.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">UNWRITTEN TRADITION AND INSUFFICIENCY OF
THE WRITTEN WORD ALONE.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">SHALL</span> next proceed to examine
the Romish assertions respecting Unwritten Tradition and the
Insufficiency of the Written Word alone.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Although the Church of Rome, speaking through the
Council of Trent, claims the Written Word of God as a voucher for
her doctrines; yet, as if conscious, that, from Scripture <span
class="GutSmall">ALONE</span>, her peculiarities cannot be
established as a part of divine revelation, she asserts: that
<i>Unwritten Tradition ought to be </i><a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span><i>had in</i> <span
class="GutSmall">EQUAL</span> <i>reverence with the Written
Word</i>; <i>so that</i>, <i>what cannot be proved from the
Written Word</i>, <i>must be received without hesitation</i>,
<i>if it be propounded by Unwritten Tradition</i>.</p>
<p>From this assertion it evidently results: that, <i>Without the
concurrence of a supplemental Unwritten Tradition</i>, <i>the
Written Word or the Holy Bible is defective and insufficient as a
rule of faith and practice</i>.</p>
<p><i>The Holy Synod</i>, say the doctors of the Council of
Trent, <i>perceiving</i>, <i>that this faith and discipline are
contained</i>, <i>both in the Written Books</i>, <i>and in the
Unwritten Traditions which have descended to us from Christ and
his Apostles</i>, <i>receives and venerates</i>, <i>after the
example of the orthodox Fathers</i>, <span class="GutSmall">WITH
AN EQUAL AFFECTION AND PIOUS REVERENCE</span>, <i>both all the
Books of the Old and New Testaments</i>, <i>and likewise the
Traditions themselves</i>, <i>whether appertaining to faith or to
morals</i>, <i>as if orally dictated from Christ and the Holy
Spirit</i>, <i>and as preserved by continual succession in the
Church Catholic</i>. <a name="citation30"></a><a
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a></p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Let us now hear what Scripture says on the topic at
present under discussion.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The unwritten traditions of the Rabbins, by which
they made void the Law of God, claimed to have been delivered to
Moses on Mount Sinai by the Lord himself: and their pretended
authenticity rested precisely upon the same mode of reasoning, as
that employed, for their parallel unwritten traditions, by the
Clergy of the Roman Communion.&nbsp; Yet Christ reprobated such
vain unhallowed phantasies in language and on principles, which
equally apply to the antiscriptural unwritten traditions of the
Latin Church.</p>
<p><i>He answered and said unto them</i>: <i>Why do ye also
transgress the commandment of God by your tradition</i>?&nbsp;
<i>For God commanded</i>, <i>saying</i>: <i>Honour </i><a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span><i>thy father
and thy mother</i>; <i>and</i>: <i>He that curseth father or
mother</i>, <i>let him die the death</i>.&nbsp; <i>But ye
say</i>: <i>Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother</i>;
<i>It is a gift by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by
me</i>; <i>and honour not his father or his mother</i>, <i>he
shall be free</i>.&nbsp; <i>Thus have ye made the commandment of
God of none effect by your tradition</i>. <a
name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a></p>
<p>Now where is the perceptible difference, between the conduct
of the Jewish Rabbins, and the conduct of the Romish Clergy?</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The Written Word commanded: that a man should
honour his father and mother.</p>
<p>But the Jewish Rabbins made this commandment of none effect by
their Unwritten Tradition: that, if a man vowed to dedicate his
substance to God, he was not bound to relieve out of it the
necessities of his parents.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; The Written Word has prohibited the bowing down
before graven images and the invocation of any being save the
Deity.</p>
<p>But the Romish Clergy have made this prohibition of none
effect by their Unwritten Tradition: that images may be
worshipped relatively with the worship due to their prototypes,
that dead saints may be justifiably invocated to give us their
intercessory assistance, and that, provided only we take care to
denominate the worship of the Saints and the Virgin <i>Dulia</i>
and <i>Hyperdulia</i> while we rigidly style the worship of the
Deity <i>Latria</i>, we may laudably (after the precise manner of
the old Pagan idolaters <a name="citation31b"></a><a
href="#footnote31b" class="citation">[31b]</a>) kiss and uncover
our heads and fall prostrate before their images, duly through
each image (again on the exact avowed principle of the same Old
Pagan idolaters <a name="citation31c"></a><a href="#footnote31c"
class="citation">[31c]</a>) referring to each being represented
by <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>such
image his own appropriate reverence and adoration. <a
name="citation32a"></a><a href="#footnote32a"
class="citation">[32a]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A similar admonition, against the vanity of following
Unwritten Tradition rather than the certainty of the Written
Word, is given by the Apostle St. Paul.</p>
<p><i>As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord</i>,
<i>so walk ye in him</i>; <i>rooted and built up in him</i>,
<i>and stablished in the faith</i>, <i>as ye have been
taught</i>, <i>abounding therein with thanksgiving</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Beware</i>, <i>lest any man spoil you through philosophy and
vain deceit</i>, <i>after the tradition of men</i>, <i>after the
rudiments of the world</i>, <i>and not after Christ</i>. <a
name="citation32b"></a><a href="#footnote32b"
class="citation">[32b]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The romish pretence of <i>an</i> <span
class="GutSmall">EQUALLY</span> <i>authoritative Unwritten
Tradition</i> plainly involves an assertion of <i>the
Insufficiency of the Written Word</i>.&nbsp; But the written Word
declares its own Sufficiency.&nbsp; Therefore, on that precise
ground, it condemns the romish pretence of an <span
class="GutSmall">EQUALLY</span> authoritative concurrent
Unwritten Tradition.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; <i>Ye shall not add unto the word which I command
you</i>, <i>neither shall ye diminish ought from it</i>: <i>that
ye may keep the commandments of the Lord your God</i>, <i>which I
command you</i>. <a name="citation32c"></a><a href="#footnote32c"
class="citation">[32c]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; <i>To the law and to the testimony</i>: <i>if they
speak not according to this word</i>, <i>it is because there is
no light in them</i>. <a name="citation32d"></a><a
href="#footnote32d" class="citation">[32d]</a></p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; <i>Though we or an angel from heaven preach any
other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto
you</i>, <i>let him be accursed</i>. <a name="citation32e"></a><a
href="#footnote32e" class="citation">[32e]</a></p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; <i>From a child</i>, <i>thou hast known the holy
scriptures</i>, <i>which are able to make thee wise unto
salvation</i>, <i>through faith which is in Christ
Jesus</i>.&nbsp; <i>All scripture is given by inspiration of
God</i>: <i>and is profitable for doctrine</i>, <i>for
reproof</i>, <i>for correction</i>, <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span><i>for instruction in
righteousness</i>; <i>that the man of God may be perfect</i>,
<i>throughly furnished unto all good works</i>. <a
name="citation33a"></a><a href="#footnote33a"
class="citation">[33a]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The Romish Clergy are wont to tell us, that their
scheme of concurrent Unwritten Tradition is recognised and
enjoined even by Scripture: because St. Paul speaks of a brother,
walking disorderly, and not after the <span
class="GutSmall">TRADITION</span> received from himself by the
Thessalonians; <a name="citation33b"></a><a href="#footnote33b"
class="citation">[33b]</a> because the same St. Paul exhorts the
same Thessalonians to stand fast and hold the <span
class="GutSmall">TRADITIONS</span> which they had been taught
whether by word or by his epistle; <a name="citation33c"></a><a
href="#footnote33c" class="citation">[33c]</a> and because still
the same St. Paul praises the Corinthians, for remembering him in
all things, and for keeping the <span
class="GutSmall">TRADITIONS</span> as he delivered to them. <a
name="citation33d"></a><a href="#footnote33d"
class="citation">[33d]</a></p>
<p>Respecting this vain plea, which can only mislead the ignorant
and the incautious, we readily answer in manner following.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; St. Paul must not be interpreted, so as to
contradict both his Lord and himself.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; The Romish Clergy cannot prove, that <i>all</i> the
Traditions, mentioned by the Apostle, were <i>unwritten</i>: for
<i>some</i> are distinctly specified as taught by a
<i>written</i> epistle; and the simple word <i>Tradition</i>
itself, which merely denotes <i>any thing handed down or
delivered or communicated</i>, has no necessary reference to what
is <i>unwritten</i> rather than to what is <i>written</i>.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; It is not known by the Romish Clergy: whether the
<i>originally</i> oral unwritten traditions, mentioned by St.
Paul, were not <i>finally</i> committed to durable writing in
documents, composed <i>subsequently</i> to those epistles in
which he mentions them, and <i>afterward</i> added to the sacred
canon; so that, what were <i>once</i> unwritten traditions,
became <i>ultimately</i> a portion of our present written word:
for the plain reader may be usefully taught or reminded, that <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>several
portions of the New Testament were written at a <i>later</i>
period than the epistles in which St. Paul speaks of
Traditions.</p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; Whensoever the Romish Clergy shall <i>prove</i> the
unwritten traditions of their Church to have been received from
Christ and his apostles with as much certainty, as the
Thessalonians and Corinthians <i>knew</i> what they had
personally received from the mouth of St. Paul: we will
cheerfully attend to them with all due reverence.</p>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; Both on the principle of our Lord&rsquo;s own
censure of the rabbinical traditions, and likewise on the
principle of plain common sense, we cannot embrace oral
traditions purporting to be God&rsquo;s unwritten word; when they
are <i>palpably irreconcileable with</i>, and <i>grossly
contradictory to</i>, God&rsquo;s own acknowledged written
word.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; We may now, in the way of historical testimony, go
on profitably to hear the ancient Fathers: those identical old
orthodox Fathers to wit; whom, in respect to the present
question, the doctors of the Council of Trent, as the reader may
peradventure recollect, claim as being clearly and indisputably
quite their own.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Let us first attend to Iren&egrave;us in the second
century.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The disposition of our salvation we know not
through any other persons, than those by whom the Gospel has come
to us: which then, indeed, they themselves orally preached; but
which afterward, according to the will of God, they traditionally
handed down to us <span class="GutSmall">IN THE WRITTEN
WORD</span>, as the future basis and column of our faith. <a
name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; When the Gnostics are confuted from <span
class="GutSmall">SCRIPTURE</span>, their answer is: that, <i>By
those who are ignorant of</i> <span class="GutSmall">UNWRITTEN
TRADITION</span>, <i>truth cannot be discovered from</i> <span
class="GutSmall">THE WRITTEN WORD</span>; <i>for truth was </i><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span><i>delivered</i>, <i>not</i> (merely) <i>through
letters</i>, <i>but through the living voice</i>. <a
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Let us next hear Tertullian in the second and third
centuries.</p>
<p>As for Hermogenes, let his shop produce <span
class="GutSmall">THE WRITTEN WORD</span>.&nbsp; If he be unable
to produce <span class="GutSmall">THE WRITTEN WORD</span> in
substantiation of his tenets; let him dread that scriptural
<i>Woe</i>, which is destined to those who either add to it or
detract from it. <a name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b"
class="citation">[35b]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Let us next hear Hippolytus in the third century.</p>
<p>There is one God, whom we know from no other authority, than
<span class="GutSmall">THE HOLY
SCRIPTURES</span>.&mdash;Whatsoever matters, then, <span
class="GutSmall">THE DIVINE SCRIPTURES</span> declare; these let
us learn: and, whatsoever matters they teach; these let us
recognise:&mdash;not according to our own humour or according to
our own mind, neither with any wresting of the things delivered
from God; but, even as he himself wished <span
class="GutSmall">THROUGH THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</span> to shew us,
thus let us learn. <a name="citation35c"></a><a
href="#footnote35c" class="citation">[35c]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Let us next hear Cyprian in the third century.</p>
<p>Whence is that pretended <span
class="GutSmall">TRADITION</span>?&nbsp; Does it descend from the
authority of the Lord and the Gospels: or does it come down from
the mandates and letters of the Apostles?&nbsp; God testifies,
that those things are to be done, which are <span
class="GutSmall">WRITTEN</span>.&mdash;If, then, any such precept
can be found, <span class="GutSmall">EITHER IN THE GOSPEL OR IN
THE EPISTLES AND ACTS OF THE APOSTLES</span>:&mdash;let this
divine and holy (written) tradition be observed. <a
name="citation35d"></a><a href="#footnote35d"
class="citation">[35d]</a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Let us next hear Cyril of Jerusalem in the fourth
century.</p>
<p>Respecting the divine and holy mysteries of the faith, not
even a tittle ought to be delivered without the authority of
<span class="GutSmall">THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</span>.&nbsp; Neither
<a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>ought any
thing to be propounded, on the basis of mere credibility, or
through the medium of plausible ratiocination.&nbsp; Neither yet
repose the slightest confidence in the bare assertions of me your
Catechist, unless you shall receive from <span
class="GutSmall">THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</span> foil demonstration of
the matters propounded.&nbsp; For the security of our faith
depends, not upon verbal trickery, but upon demonstration from
<span class="GutSmall">THE HOLY SCRIPTURES</span>. <a
name="citation36a"></a><a href="#footnote36a"
class="citation">[36a]</a></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Let us next hear the great Athanasius in the fourth
century.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The holy and divinely inspired <span
class="GutSmall">SCRIPTURES</span> are sufficient for the
declaration of the truth. <a name="citation36b"></a><a
href="#footnote36b" class="citation">[36b]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Let a person solely learn the matters, which are
set forth in <span class="GutSmall">THE SCRIPTURES</span>: for
the demonstrations, contained in them, are, in order to the
settling of this point, quite sufficient and complete. <a
name="citation36c"></a><a href="#footnote36c"
class="citation">[36c]</a></p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; If ye are disciples of the Gospels,&mdash;walk
according to <span class="GutSmall">WHAT IS WRITTEN</span>.&nbsp;
But, if you choose to allege any other matters <span
class="GutSmall">BEYOND WHAT IS WRITTEN</span>: why do you
contend against us, <span class="GutSmall">WHO WILL NEVER BE
PERSUADED EITHER TO HEAR OR TO SPEAK A SINGLE SYLLABLE BEYOND
GOD&rsquo;S WRITTEN WORD</span>? <a name="citation36d"></a><a
href="#footnote36d" class="citation">[36d]</a></p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; These; namely, the canonical books of Scripture,
from which the apocryphal books are carefully excluded by the
accurate Father: These are the fountains of salvation; so that
he, who thirsts, may drink from the oracles contained in
them.&nbsp; In <span class="GutSmall">THESE ALONE</span> is the
evangelical school of piety.&nbsp; Let no one add to them: and

<p>7.&nbsp; Let us next hear Basil in the fourth century.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; It is a manifest apostasy from the faith, and a
clear proof of arrogance, either to disregard any matter of <span
class="GutSmall">THE THINGS WHICH ARE WRITTEN</span>, Or to
introduce argumentatively any matter of <span

<p>(1.)&nbsp; As we deny not <span class="GutSmall">THE THINGS
WHICH ARE WRITTEN</span>: <span class="GutSmall">SO THE THINGS

has written to Jubaianus: and I should then have no room for

38</span>IV.&nbsp; From the evidence now faithfully laid before
him, the prudent inquirer is invited to judge for himself:
whether the romish doctrine, of <i>the concurrent</i> <span
class="GutSmall">EQUAL</span> <i>authority of Unwritten Tradition
and the insufficiency of the Written Word alone</i>, be warranted
either by Scripture or by the early Fathers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the following questions may not be altogether
unworthy of his attention.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Do, or do not, the doctors of the Council of Trent,
agreeably to their own formal and distinct profession, follow the
example of the old orthodox Fathers, when they decide: that
<i>the Written Word of God</i>, <i>and the Unwritten Traditions
of the Latin Church</i>, <i>are to be received by the faithful
with an</i> <span class="GutSmall">EQUAL</span> <i>affection and
pious reverence</i>?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Do, or do not, the Romish Clergy imitate the
Gnostics: who, when they were confuted from Scripture, were
accustomed to reply; that, <i>by those who are ignorant of
Unwritten Tradition</i>, <i>truth cannot be discovered from the
Written Word</i>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Do, or do not, the Romish Clergy copy the example of
Cyril of Jerusalem: who declared, that, <i>respecting the
faith</i>, <span class="GutSmall">NOT A TITTLE</span> <i>ought to
be delivered without the authority of the Holy Scriptures</i>;
and who exhorted his Catechumens to <i>repose not</i> <span
class="GutSmall">THE SLIGHTEST CONFIDENCE</span> <i>in his
assertions</i>, <i>unless they should receive from the Holy
Scriptures full demonstration of the matters propounded</i>?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Do, or do not, the Romish Clergy teach, with
Athanasius: that, <i>the Scriptures</i> <span
class="GutSmall">ALONE</span> <i>are sufficient for the
declaration of the truth</i>; and that, <i>in the canonical
Scriptures</i> <span class="GutSmall">ALONE</span>, <i>to the
exclusion of the Apocrypha</i>, <i>is the evangelical school of
piety</i>?</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Do, or do not, the Romish Clergy declare, with the
same illustrious Father: that <i>they will never be persuaded
either to hear or to speak</i> <span class="GutSmall">A SINGLE
SYLLABLE</span> <i>beyond God&rsquo;s written word</i>?</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Do, or do not, the Romish Clergy pronounce, <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>still with
the great Athanasius: that <i>it is the part of mere triflers to
propound and to speak the things which are not written</i>?</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Do, or do not, the doctors of the Council of Trent,
and after them our present Romish Clergy, take up, and make their
own, the ancient pithy distinction of Jerome: <i>The things which
are written we acknowledge</i>; <i>the things which are not
written we reject</i>?</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Do, or do not, the Romish Clergy, make a point, with
Tertullian, of <i>always requiring the production of proof from
the Written Word</i>: and do they, or do they not, allow and
maintain, with the same Father; that <i>he</i>, <i>who is unable
to produce the Written Word in substantiation of his tenets</i>,
<i>but who for that purpose resorts to Unwritten Tradition</i>,
<i>may well dread the awful Woe so justly denounced against those
who either add to it or detract from it</i>?</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Finally, in their several estimates of Unwritten
Tradition and the Written Word, and in their several modes of
conducting those theological controversies which respect the
authoritative rule of faith and practice, do the Romish Clergy or
the Reformed Clergy approximate most closely to Holy Scripture
and to the ancient orthodox Fathers?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MERITORIOUS SATISFACTION.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the perfect equality of
Unwritten Tradition and the Written Word of God, we may next
proceed to the doctrine of Meritorious Satisfaction.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The Church of Rome lays down her decision, respecting
what she calls <i>Works of Satisfaction</i>, in manner
following.</p>
<p><i>So great is the abundance of divine munificence</i>,
<i>that we are able to make satisfaction to God the Father
through Jesus Christ</i>, <i>not only by punishments </i><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span><i>either
spontaneously undergone by ourselves for the avenging of sin or
imposed upon us by the will of the priest according to the
measure of our offence</i>, <i>but also</i> (<i>what is the
greatest argument of love</i>) <i>by temporal flagellations
inflicted of God and by us patiently endured</i>. <a
name="citation40a"></a><a href="#footnote40a"
class="citation">[40a]</a></p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Thus speaks the Roman Church: let us now hear the
declarations of Holy Scripture.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>When ye shall have done all those things which are
commanded you</i>, <i>say</i>: <i>We are unprofitable
servants</i>; <i>we have done that which it was our duty to
do</i>. <a name="citation40b"></a><a href="#footnote40b"
class="citation">[40b]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>Two men went up into the temple to pray</i>:
<i>the one</i>, <i>a Pharisee</i>; <i>and the other</i>, <i>a
Publican</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Pharisee stood</i>, <i>and prayed thus
with himself</i>: <i>God</i>, <i>I thank thee</i>, <i>that I am
not as other men are</i>, <i>extortioners</i>, <i>unjust</i>,
<i>adulterers</i>, <i>or even as this Publican</i>.&nbsp; <i>I
fast twice in the week</i>: <i>I give tythes of all that I
possess</i>.&nbsp; <i>And the Publican</i>, <i>standing afar
off</i>, <i>would not lift up so much as his eyes unto
heaven</i>; <i>but smote upon his breast</i>, <i>saying</i>:
<i>God be merciful to me a sinner</i>!&nbsp; <i>I tell you</i>:
<i>This man went down to his house justified rather than the
other</i>: <i>for every one</i>, <i>that exalteth himself</i>,
<i>shall be abased</i>; <i>and he</i>, <i>that humbleth
himself</i>, <i>shall be exalted</i>. <a
name="citation40c"></a><a href="#footnote40c"
class="citation">[40c]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>Where is boasting then</i>?&nbsp; <i>It is
excluded</i>.&nbsp; <i>By what law</i>?&nbsp; <i>Of
works</i>?&nbsp; <i>Nay</i>, <i>but by the law of
faith</i>.&nbsp; <i>Therefore we conclude</i>: <i>that a man is
justified by faith</i>, <i>without the deeds of the law</i>. <a
name="citation40d"></a><a href="#footnote40d"
class="citation">[40d]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>If Abraham were justified by works</i>, <i>he hath
whereof to glory</i>, <i>but not before God</i>.&nbsp; <i>For
what saith the Scripture</i>?&nbsp; <i>Abraham believed God</i>:
<i>and it was counted unto him for righteousness</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Now</i>, <i>to him that worketh</i>, <i>is the reward
reckoned</i>, <i>not of grace</i>, <i>but of debt</i>.&nbsp;
<i>But</i>, <i>to him that worketh not</i>, <i>but believeth on
him that justifieth the ungodly</i>, <i>his faith is counted for
righteousness</i>. <a name="citation40e"></a><a
href="#footnote40e" class="citation">[40e]</a></p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>5.&nbsp; <i>Therefore</i>, <i>being justified by
faith</i>, <i>we have peace with God</i>, <i>through our Lord
Jesus Christ</i>. <a name="citation41a"></a><a
href="#footnote41a" class="citation">[41a]</a></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>They</i>, <i>being ignorant of God&rsquo;s
righteousness</i>, <i>and going about to establish their own
righteousness</i>, <i>have not submitted themselves unto the
righteousness of God</i>. <a name="citation41b"></a><a
href="#footnote41b" class="citation">[41b]</a></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; <i>We are all as an unclean thing</i>: <i>and all our
righteousnesses are as filthy rags</i>. <a
name="citation41c"></a><a href="#footnote41c"
class="citation">[41c]</a></p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Let us next attend to the language of the old
orthodox Fathers.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Clement of Rome, in the first century, speaks as
follows.</p>
<p>All, therefore, have been glorified and magnified, not through
themselves or through their own works of righteousness which they
have done, but through the will of God.&nbsp; Wherefore, being
called through his will in Christ Jesus, we are justified, not
through ourselves, or through our own wisdom or intellect or
piety, or through the works which we have wrought in holiness of
heart; but through faith, by which the Almighty God has justified
us all from everlasting. <a name="citation41d"></a><a
href="#footnote41d" class="citation">[41d]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The author of the Epistle to Diognetus, in the first
or second century, speaks exactly to the same purpose.</p>
<p>What else can cover our sins, than the righteousness of
Christ?&nbsp; In what can we lawless and impious wretches be
justified, save only in the Son of God? <a
name="citation41e"></a><a href="#footnote41e"
class="citation">[41e]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Ambrose of Milan, in the fourth century, still holds
the same language.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; By what labours, by what injuries, can we lighten
our sins?&nbsp; The sufferings of this time are, in reference to
future glory, altogether unworthy.&nbsp; Hence, toward man, the
form of celestial decrees <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>proceeds, not according to our
merits, but according to the mercy of God. <a
name="citation42a"></a><a href="#footnote42a"
class="citation">[42a]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Would that the Lord would not reject, but collect,
this my mere stubble in the harvest, these empty wild oats of my
fructification!&mdash;It is fitting, therefore, to believe; both
that penance is to be performed, and that pardon is to be
granted: nevertheless, in such manner, that we should hope for
pardon, as from faith, not as from debt. <a
name="citation42b"></a><a href="#footnote42b"
class="citation">[42b]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Augustine, in the fourth and fifth centuries, exactly
agrees with his predecessors.</p>
<p>The sins are thine: the merits are God&rsquo;s.&nbsp; To thee
punishment is due: and when the reward shall come, he will crown
his own gifts, not thy merits. <a name="citation42c"></a><a
href="#footnote42c" class="citation">[42c]</a></p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Let the patient enquirer now judge for himself:
whether the romish doctrine, that <i>Punishments</i>, <i>either
self-inflicted</i>, <i>or commanded by a priest</i>, <i>or sent
in the course of God&rsquo;s providence</i>, <i>can make
satisfaction to the Father through Christ in our behalf</i>, be
the doctrine either of Scripture or of the early Church.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; But, if no man can make satisfaction for <i>his
own</i> sins: still less, according to the monstrous phantasy of
Supererogation, can he make satisfaction for the sins of
<i>others</i>.</p>
<p>Yet this impious absurdity was openly advanced in the papal
bull for the observation of a jubilee is the recent year
1825.</p>
<p><i>We have resolved</i>, says Pope Leo, <span
class="GutSmall">BY VIRTUE OF THE AUTHORITY GIVEN TO US FROM
HEAVEN</span>, <i>fully to unlock that sacred treasure</i>,
<i>composed of the merits</i>, <i>sufferings</i>, <i>and
virtues</i>, <i>of Christ our Lord and of his Virgin-Mother and
of all the Saints</i>, <span class="GutSmall">WHICH THE AUTHOR OF
HUMAN SALVATION HAS ENTRUSTED TO </span><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span><span
class="GutSmall">OUR DISPENSATION</span>.&mdash;<i>To you</i>,
<i>therefore</i>, <i>venerable brethren</i>, <i>Patriarchs</i>,
<i>Primates</i>, <i>Archbishops</i>, <i>Bishops</i>, <i>it
belongs to explain with perspicuity the power of Indulgences</i>:
<i>what is their efficacy in the remission</i>, <i>not only of
the canonical penance</i>, <i>but also of the temporal punishment
due to the divine justice for past sin</i>; <i>and what succour
is afforded</i>, <i>out of this heavenly treasure</i>, <i>from
the merits of Christ and his Saints</i>, <i>to such as have
departed real penitents in God&rsquo;s love</i>, <i>yet before
they had duly satisfied by fruits worthy of penance for sins of
commission and omission</i>, <i>and are now purifying in the fire
of Purgatory</i>, <i>that an entrance may be opened for them into
their eternal country where nothing defiled is admitted</i>.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Where is Pope Leo&rsquo;s <span
class="GutSmall">PROOF</span> of the validity of his claim to
<i>an authority given to him from heaven</i>: <i>by virtue of
which authority he fully unlocks a sacred treasure</i>,
<i>composed of the merits of Christ and the Virgin Mary and all
the Saints</i>, <i>and entrusted by the blessed author of our
salvation to the wisdom of his doling out</i>?</p>
<p>Let such <span class="GutSmall">PROOF</span> be produced, if
the Romish Clergy <i>can</i> produce it, either from the Bible,
or even from the received doctrine of the primitive Church
Catholic.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; By what evidence does Pope Leo <span
class="GutSmall">SUBSTANTIATE</span> his assertion: that <i>Souls
in Purgatory are benefited by the supererogatory merits of the
Virgin Mary and the Saints strangely associated with the
all-sufficient merits of the Redeemer</i>?</p>
<p>Let the Romish Clergy, if they be <i>able</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">SUBSTANTIATE</span> this most extraordinary
allegation.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Where is Pope Leo&rsquo;s <span
class="GutSmall">PROOF</span> of the very position, upon which
the whole of his bull professedly reposes; the position, to wit:
that <i>The Virgin Mary and the Saints not only have merit enough
to make satisfaction for their own sins</i>, <i>but have even
merit to spare for the benefit of less privileged souls in
Purgatory</i>?</p>
<p>From the Bible or from the Doctors of the primitive Church,
let his venerable brethren, Patriarchs, <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Primates,
Archbishops, and Bishops, bring forward, if they can accomplish
such a feat, the <span class="GutSmall">PROOF</span> of this very
remarkable position.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">SAINT-WORSHIP, IMAGE-WORSHIP,
RELIC-WORSHIP, CROSS-WORSHIP.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="GutSmall">SHALL</span> next examine the
doctrine and practice of Saint-worship, Image-worship,
Relic-worship, and Cross-worship.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; In exhibiting the tenets of the Romish Church and
Clergy on these several points, I shall successively give: the
decision of the council of Trent; the comments of some of the
most approved Latin Doctors; and the actual practice of the
Romanists themselves as the best explanation of their received
tenets.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Let us first hear the decision of the Council of
Trent.</p>
<p><i>All Bishops</i>, <i>and others who discharge the duty of
teaching</i>, <i>must diligently instruct the faithful</i>,
<i>concerning the intercession and invocation of the Saints</i>,
<i>the honouring of Relics</i>, <i>and the legitimate use of
Images</i>.</p>
<p><i>For this purpose</i>, <i>they must teach them</i>: <i>that
the Saints</i>, <i>reigning with Christ</i>, <i>offer up their
prayers to God for men</i>; <i>and that it is good and
useful</i>, <i>suppliantly to invoke them</i>, <i>and to flee to
their prayers and assistance for the purpose of obtaining
benefits from God through his Son Jesus Christ our Lord who is
our only Redeemer and Saviour</i>.</p>
<p><i>Furthermore</i>, <i>they must teach them</i>: <i>that
those</i>, <i>who deny that the Saints in heaven ought to be
invoked</i>, <i>or who assert either that they do not pray for
men or that the invoking of them to pray for us is idolatry or
that it is contrary to God&rsquo;s word and adverse </i><a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span><i>to the
honour of Jesus Christ the only mediator between God and man or
that it is foolish by voice or in mind to supplicate those who
reign in heaven</i>, <i>think impiously</i>.</p>
<p><i>They must also teach them</i>: <i>that the holy bodies of
the Saints and Martyrs and others living with Christ are to be
venerated by the faithful</i>, <i>through which many benefits are
afforded from God to men</i>; <i>so that the affirmers</i>,
<i>that veneration and honour are not due to the Relics of the
Saints</i>, <i>or that these and other sacred monuments are
uselessly honoured by the faithful</i>, <i>or that it is vain to
celebrate the memories of the Saints for the purpose of obtaining
their assistance</i>, <i>are wholly to be condemned</i>, <i>as
the Church long since condemned and still condemns them</i>.</p>
<p><i>Likewise</i>, <i>they must teach them</i>: <i>that the
Images of Christ and of the Virgin Mother of God and of the other
Saints are especially to be had and retained in Churches</i>,
<i>and that due honour and veneration are to be paid to them</i>;
<i>not that any divinity or virtue</i>, <i>on account of which
they ought to be worshipped</i>, <i>is believed to be inherent in
them</i>; <i>or that any thing is to be sought from them</i>;
<i>or that trust is to be placed in Images</i>, <i>as was
formerly done by the Gentiles</i>, <i>who placed their hope in
Idols</i>; <i>but because the honour</i>, <i>which is paid to
them</i>, <i>is referred to the originals which they
represent</i>; <i>so that</i>, <i>through the Images which we
kiss and before which we uncover our heads and bow down
prostrate</i>, <i>we adore Christ and venerate the Saints whose
similitude they bear</i>. <a name="citation45"></a><a
href="#footnote45" class="citation">[45]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Let us next, upon the doctrinal and practical system
of the professedly unchangeable Church of Rome, hear the comments
of some of the most approved Latin Doctors both before and after
the Council of Trent.</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>(1.)&nbsp; From Thomas Aquinas, who was not only a
mighty Schoolman but also a canonised Saint of the Roman Church,
we may clearly hope to derive the very best and most accurate
instruction as to the <i>real</i> tenets of his Communion.&nbsp;
Now this writer, through the medium of a syllogism professedly
framed upon an <i>authorised</i> Prayer in the Breviary,
establishes the <span class="GutSmall">DUTY</span> of worshipping
the cross with the self-same adoration as that which is paid to
the Deity.</p>
<p><i>We offer the supreme adoration of Latria to that Being</i>,
<i>in whom we place our hope of salvation</i>.&nbsp; <i>But we
place our hope of salvation in the cross of Christ</i>: <i>for
the Church sings</i>; <i>Hail</i>, <i>O cross</i>, <i>our only
hope in this time of passion</i>, <i>increase righteousness to
the pious</i>, <i>and grant pardon to the guilty</i>.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Therefore</span> <i>the cross of Christ is to be
adored with the supreme adoration of Latria</i>. <a
name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Much wholesome instruction, in regard to the
legitimate use of Images, may also be derived from the
expositorial comment of James Naclantus Bishop of Clugium.</p>
<p><i>We must not only confess</i>, <i>that the faithful in the
Church worship before an Image</i>; <i>as some over-squeamish
souls might peradventure express themselves</i>: <i>but we must
furthermore confess</i>, <i>without the slightest scruple of
conscience</i>, <i>that</i> <span class="GutSmall">THEY ADORE THE
VERY IMAGE ITSELF</span>; <i>for</i>, <i>in sooth</i>, <i>they
venerate it with the identical worship wherewith they venerate
its prototype</i>.&nbsp; <i>Hence</i>, <span class="GutSmall">IF
THEY ADORE THE PROTOTYPE WITH THAT DIVINE WORSHIP WHICH IS
RENDERED TO GOD AND WHICH TECHNICALLY BEARS THE NAME OF
LATRIA</span>, <span class="GutSmall">THEY ADORE ALSO THE IMAGE
WITH THE SAME LATRIA OR SUPREME DIVINE WORSHIP</span>:
<i>and</i>, <i>if they adore the prototype with Dulia or
Hyperdulia</i>, <i>they are bound also to adore the Image with
the self-same species of inferior worship</i>. <a
name="citation46b"></a><a href="#footnote46b"
class="citation">[46b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>(3.)&nbsp; In exactly the same expository strain
proceeds Gabriel Biel, in his Lectures upon the Canon of the
Mass.</p>
<p><i>If there shall be Images of Christ</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">THEY ARE ADORED WITH THE SAME SPECIES OF
ADORATION AS CHRIST HIMSELF</span>, <span class="GutSmall">THAT
IS</span>, <span class="GutSmall">WITH THE SUPREME ADORATION
CALLED LATRIA</span>: <i>if</i>, <i>of the most blessed
Virgin</i>; <i>with the worship of Hyperdulia</i>. <a
name="citation47a"></a><a href="#footnote47a"
class="citation">[47a]</a></p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; The commentary of Peter de Medrano will throw yet
additional light on the subject.</p>
<p><i>We must say</i>: <i>that</i>, <i>to our Lady the Mother of
God</i>, <i>there has been granted the remarkable privilege of
being physically and really present in some of her statues or
images</i>.&mdash;<i>Hence we must piously believe</i>:
<i>that</i>, <i>in some celebrated statues or images of
herself</i>, <i>she is inherent and present</i>,
<i>personally</i>, <i>physically</i>, <i>and
really</i>;&mdash;<i>in order that</i>, <i>in them</i>, <i>she
may receive</i>, <i>from faithful worshippers</i>, <i>her due
adoration</i>. <a name="citation47b"></a><a href="#footnote47b"
class="citation">[47b]</a></p>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; Yet still further light breaks in upon us from the
statements of Aringhi, penned and published at Rome under the
very nose of the sovereign Pontiff.</p>
<p><i>This Image</i>, <i>translated from the city of Edessa</i>,
<i>is at once preserved as a bulwark against mad
Image-breakers</i>, <i>and is set forth to be taken up and</i>
<span class="GutSmall">ADORED</span> <i>by the faithful</i>. <a
name="citation47c"></a><a href="#footnote47c"
class="citation">[47c]</a></p>
<p><i>Within these few years</i>, <i>under every Pope
successively</i>, <i>some or other of our sacred Images</i>,
<i>especially of the more ancient</i>, <i>have made themselves
illustrious</i>, <i>and have acquired</i> <span
class="GutSmall">A PECULIAR WORSHIP AND VENERATION</span>, <i>by
the exhibition of fresh miracles</i>; <i>as it is notorious to
all</i>, <i>who dwell in this city</i>. <a
name="citation47d"></a><a href="#footnote47d"
class="citation">[47d]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Let us finally attend to the actual liturgical
practice of the Romanists themselves, as the best explanation of
the tenets received and inculcated by their Clergy: for, clearly,
as men are taught to believe <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>and to act, so will their authorised
public prayers be constructed.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Hail, O cross, our only hope in this time of
passion: increase righteousness to the pious, and grant pardon to
the guilty. <a name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Holy Mary, succour the miserable, assist the
pusillanimous, comfort the mournful. <a name="citation48b"></a><a
href="#footnote48b" class="citation">[48b]</a></p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; O singular Virgin, mild among all, make us, being
delivered from our sins, mild and chaste.&nbsp; Grant us purity
of life; prepare for us a safe journey: that, seeing Jesus, we
may always jointly rejoice. <a name="citation48c"></a><a
href="#footnote48c" class="citation">[48c]</a></p>
<p>(4.)&nbsp; Mary, mother of grace, mother of mercy, do thou
protect us from the enemy, and receive us in the hour of
death.&nbsp; Unloose their bonds to the guilty: give light to the
blind: drive away our evils: demand all good things.&nbsp; Shew
thyself to be a mother.&nbsp; Let him, who for us endured to be
thy son, receive our prayers through thee. <a
name="citation48d"></a><a href="#footnote48d"
class="citation">[48d]</a></p>
<p>(5.)&nbsp; O George, illustrious martyr, praise and glory
become thee.&mdash;We beseech thee, in our inmost heart, that,
with all the faithful, we may be joined to the citizens of
heaven, being washed from our impurities. <a
name="citation48e"></a><a href="#footnote48e"
class="citation">[48e]</a></p>

<p>II.&nbsp; After this ample statement of the doctrine and
practice of the Roman Church, it will be useful for us to
observe, both <i>negatively</i> what the Bible <i>does not</i>
say, and <i>positively</i> what the Bible <i>does</i> say, on the
subject now before us.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; In the first place, then, so far as respects the
<i>negative</i> part of the question, the Bible is <span
class="GutSmall">TOTALLY SILENT</span>, as to the
Trent-inculcated duty, of invoking Saints, venerating Relics, and
kissing and uncovering the head and falling prostrate before
Images either in nitches or upon crucifixes.</p>
<p>It <span class="GutSmall">NO WHERE</span> recognises or
recommends any such practices and notions: as those, of invoking
dead Saints, to aid us by their prayers, or to grant us purity of
life, or to unloose the bands of the guilty, or to make us mild
and chaste, or to defend us in life, or to assist us in the hour
of death; of celebrating their memories, for the avowed purpose
of obtaining their <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>help and protection; of much benefit being derived, from
God to man by the veneration of Relics; of worshipping Christ and
venerating the Saints, through the medium of worship and
veneration paid relatively to Images; of beseeching the cross, a
mere dumb piece of wood even if any of its remains should now be
actually in existence, to increase righteousness to the pious and
to grant pardon to the guilty.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, <span class="GutSmall">NOT A
SYLLABLE</span> of sanction or approbation, in regard to any such
phantasies can we discover in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
<p>Hence, even to say the very least of the matter, the doctrine,
avowedly taught and liturgically introduced by the Church of
Rome, has not the slightest support or warrant from the Written
Word of God.&nbsp; Whatever be the ground, upon which it rests:
at all events, it clearly rests <i>not</i> upon the Bible.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; But this is not all.&nbsp; For, in the second place,
so far as respects the <i>positive</i> part of the question, Holy
Scripture is full and express <span
class="GutSmall">AGAINST</span> any worship or invocation of the
creature, however disguised or modified or palliated by the
closely harmonizing distinctions and definitions of Paganism and
Popery: inasmuch as the Pagans, though slanderously
misrepresented by the doctors of the Council of Trent, did in
truth defend their Idol-worship against the primitive Christians,
on the self-same plea and principle of <i>relative adoration</i>,
as the said doctors themselves and their followers the Romish
Clergy defend their Image-worship against us Reformed Catholics.

name="citation52c"></a><a href="#footnote52c"
class="citation">[52c]</a></p>
<p>III.&nbsp; We may now profitably hear the testimony of the
early ecclesiastical writers.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Epistle of the Church of Smyrna, relative to the
martyrdom of Polycarp, was written about the middle of the second
century.</p>
<p>Nicetas was urged by the envious and the wicked to intercede
with the governor, that the remains of Polycarp should not be
delivered for sepulture: lest, leaving him that was crucified,
the Christians, it was suggested, should begin to worship this
person.&nbsp; These things they said, at the instigation of the
Jews: because they were ignorant; that neither can we ever
forsake Christ who suffered for the salvation of the saved
throughout the whole world, nor that <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>we can ever worship any other.&nbsp;
For him, being the Son of God, we adore: but the martyrs, as
disciples and imitators of the Lord, we worthily love on account
of their special affection to their own King and Master. <a
name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Clement of Alexandria flourished in the second
century.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Images, wrought by mean artizans, are produced from
worthless materials.&nbsp; Therefore they themselves must be
worthless and profane. <a name="citation53b"></a><a
href="#footnote53b" class="citation">[53b]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; An image, truly, is mere dead matter, fashioned by
the hand of the artizan.&nbsp; But, with us Christians, there is
no sensible representation formed out of sensible matter.&nbsp;
God, the alone true God, is our intellectual image. <a
name="citation53c"></a><a href="#footnote53c"
class="citation">[53c]</a></p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Minucius Felix lived in the third century.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Why have the Christians no altars, no temples, no
known images? <a name="citation53d"></a><a href="#footnote53d"
class="citation">[53d]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; We neither worship crosses, nor wish for them. <a
name="citation53e"></a><a href="#footnote53e"
class="citation">[53e]</a></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Origen lived in the third century.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Celsus remarks, that we have neither altars nor
images nor temples.&mdash;We ought not to dedicate images
constructed by the ingenuity of artizans. <a
name="citation53f"></a><a href="#footnote53f"
class="citation">[53f]</a></p>
<p>(2) We deem those the most ignorant: who are not ashamed, to
address lifeless things, to petition the weak for health, to ask
life from the dead, to pray for health from the needy.&nbsp; And,
though some may allege, that these images are not gods but only
their symbols and representations: yet even such persons,
fancying that imitations of the Deity can be made by the hands of
some mean artizan, are not a whit less ignorant and slavish and
uninstructed.&nbsp; From this sottish stupidity, the very lowest
and least informed of us Christians are exempt. <a
name="citation53g"></a><a href="#footnote53g"
class="citation">[53g]</a></p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>5.&nbsp; The Council of Elvira sat at the beginning of
the fourth century.</p>
<p>It hath seemed good to us, that pictures ought not to be
admitted into a church: lest that should be painted upon walls
which is worshipped and adored. <a name="citation54a"></a><a
href="#footnote54a" class="citation">[54a]</a></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Athanasius flourished in the fourth century.</p>
<p>We are truly worshippers of God: because we invocate no one of
the creatures nor any mere man, but the Son who is by nature from
God and true God. <a name="citation54b"></a><a
href="#footnote54b" class="citation">[54b]</a></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Augustine lived in the fourth and fifth
centuries.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Let not our point of religion be the worship of
dead men.&nbsp; For though they lived piously; still they are not
to be accounted of, as requiring from us any such honours: but
they rather wish us to worship him, through whose illumination
they rejoice that we should be partners of their merit.&nbsp;
They are to be honoured, therefore, on account of imitation; not
to be prayed to on account of religion. <a
name="citation54c"></a><a href="#footnote54c"
class="citation">[54c]</a></p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; I have known that many are adorers of sepulchres
and of pictures:&mdash;but the Church herself condemns them, and
as bad children studies to correct them. <a
name="citation54d"></a><a href="#footnote54d"
class="citation">[54d]</a></p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Epiphanius flourished in the fourth-century.</p>
<p>Let Mary be held in honour: but let the Father and the Son and
the Holy Ghost be worshipped.&nbsp; As for Mary, let no one
worship her. <a name="citation54e"></a><a href="#footnote54e"
class="citation">[54e]</a></p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Once more, let the honest inquirer freely judge and
determine for himself, whether the doctrine and practice of the
Roman Church and Clergy, relative to Saints and Images and Relics
and Crosses, be supported either by Holy Scripture or by
Primitive Antiquity.</p>
<h2><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">PAPAL SUPREMACY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> doctrine of Papal Supremacy
shall next be brought to the legitimate test of Scripture and
Historical Evidence.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; We find the claim of this supremacy authoritatively
propounded, in manner following.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>The Roman Church is the mother and mistress of all
other Churches</i>. <a name="citation55a"></a><a
href="#footnote55a" class="citation">[55a]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>I acknowledge the holy catholic and apostolic
Roman Church to be the mother and mistress of all Churches</i>:
<i>and I promise and swear true obedience to the Roman
Pontiff</i>, <i>the successor of the blessed Peter Prince of the
Apostles</i>, <i>and the Vicar of Jesus Christ</i>. <a
name="citation55b"></a><a href="#footnote55b"
class="citation">[55b]</a></p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Such, in form, is the claim: but where find we its
substantiation in the Bible?</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The Roman Church had indisputably been founded in the
apostolic age: for one of St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistles is addressed
to it.</p>
<p>Yet <span class="GutSmall">NOT A SINGLE SYLLABLE</span> is
said in Scripture, either prophetic or declarative, respecting
<i>the divine appointment</i>, and consequently <i>the divine
right</i>, of the Papal Supremacy.</p>
<p>We <span class="GutSmall">NO WHERE</span> read in Holy Writ:
either that <i>the Roman Church ought justly to be obeyed</i>,
<i>as the mother and mistress of all other Churches</i>; or that
<i>the Pope is</i>, <i>at once</i>, <i>the successor of the
blessed Peter Prince of the Apostles</i>, <i>and the Vicar of
Jesus Christ</i>.</p>
<p>From whatever quarter the divines of Trent have made these
discoveries: it is quite clear, that the Bible throws no light
upon the present subject.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>2.&nbsp; The Romish Clergy, however, assure us: that the
primacy or monarchy of the entire Catholic Church was, in the
following express terms, granted to St. Peter by Christ
himself.</p>
<p><i>Thou art Peter</i>: <i>and upon this rock I will build my
Church</i>; <i>and the gates of hell shall not prevail against
it</i>.&nbsp; <i>And I will give unto thee the keys of the
kingdom of heaven</i>: <i>and</i>, <i>whatsoever thou shalt bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven</i>; <i>and</i>, <i>whatsoever
thou shalt loose on earth</i>, <i>shall be loosed in heaven</i>.
<a name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a></p>
<p>Now, whether our Lord did or did not grant the monarchy of the
Church to Peter; respecting which monarchy, by the way, neither
claim nor trace can be found in any part of the New Testament:
the <i>true</i> question, I apprehend, touches, not <i>Peter</i>,
but <i>the Pope</i>.&nbsp; In other words, it matters little to
the point before us, whether <i>Peter</i> was or was not divinely
appointed the monarch of the Church: unless it can <i>also</i> be
proved, that <i>the Pope</i> is the lawfully and divinely
constituted successor to all Peter&rsquo;s alleged
regalities.</p>
<p>Where, then, is the scriptural demonstration of the
Pope&rsquo;s hereditary successorship to the asserted special
privileges and authority of St. Peter?&nbsp; In other words,
where have we any proof from the Bible: that <i>The Roman
Pontiff</i>, as the oath in the Tridentine Profession of Faith
determines, <i>is</i>, <i>at once</i>, <i>the Successor of the
blessed Peter Prince of the Apostles</i>, <i>and the Vicar of
Jesus Christ</i>?</p>
<p>Truly, the Bible, though we painfully search it through from
beginning to end, <span class="GutSmall">SAYS NOT ONE WORD</span>
about the matter.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; But, where the Bible is so provokingly silent,
peradventure the earliest Fathers, in delivering their testimony,
may be somewhat more communicative.</p>
<p>To establish the Pope&rsquo;s <i>claim</i> of rightful
successorship to St. Peter, we must obviously establish the <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span><span
class="GutSmall">FACT</span> that <i>St. Peter was the first
diocesan Bishop of Rome</i>.&nbsp; For, since, so far as
<i>foundership</i> is concerned, St. Peter founded <i>many</i>
Churches: the mere circumstance, even if the circumstance were
ever so well established, of his having <i>founded</i> the Roman
Church, would no more constitute <i>the Roman Bishop</i> heir to
his regalities, than the same circumstance would convey the same
privilege to <i>the Bishop of any other Church</i> similarly
<i>founded</i> by St. Peter.&nbsp; Whence it is quite clear:
that, in no method, save that of <i>The regular succession of one
diocesan Bishop to another diocesan Bishop in the same episcopal
See</i>, <i>each Bishop inheriting the duly transmitted authority
of his predecessor</i>, can any intelligible case be made out for
the Pope&rsquo;s alleged successorship to Peter in the pretended
office of Christ&rsquo;s supreme Vicar.</p>
<p>Accordingly, as the Romish Clergy well know and confess, this
precise matter is the very hinge, upon which turns the whole of
the present question.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Was</span>, <span class="GutSmall">OR WAS
NOT</span>, <span class="GutSmall">THE APOSTLE PETER THE FIRST
DIOCESAN BISHOP OF THE ROMAN CHURCH</span>?</p>
<p>We have here before us a simple question of <span
class="GutSmall">FACT</span>: and doubtless, like every other
simple question of <span class="GutSmall">FACT</span>, it must be
determined by historical testimony.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <i>Negatively</i>, then, we may safely say, that the
alleged fact of <i>Peter&rsquo;s diocesan Roman Episcopate</i> is
altogether incapable of substantiation through the medium of
evidence.</p>
<p>Not a single writer of the three first centuries gives the
slightest intimation, that <i>Peter was the first diocesan Bishop
of Rome</i>.</p>
<p>But, if the alleged fact cannot be established from the
writers of the three <i>earliest</i> centuries; it is obvious to
the meanest capacity, that it can never be established from the
interested fictions of <i>a later</i> period.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; We may, however, advance beyond <i>negativeness</i>:
though even <i>that</i> were amply sufficient; for <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>no man can be
justly required to admit an alleged fact, without so much as a
shadow of historical substantiation.&nbsp; <i>Positively</i>, we
can say: that, in the writers of the three first ages, not only
is there no testimony to be found <i>for</i> the asserted fact of
<i>Peter&rsquo;s diocesan Roman Episcopate</i>, but we are
absolutely encountered with direct testimony <i>against</i>
it.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Iren&egrave;us of Lyons, who lived from the latter
end of the first century to the latter end of the second,
distinctly attests: that <i>the Church of Rome was</i> <span
class="GutSmall">JOINTLY</span> <i>founded by the</i> <span
class="GutSmall">TWO</span> <i>Apostles Peter and Paul</i>; and
that, <i>When the</i> <span class="GutSmall">TWO</span>
<i>Apostles had thus</i> <span class="GutSmall">JOINTLY</span>
<i>founded it</i>, <i>they</i> <span
class="GutSmall">JOINTLY</span> <i>delivered the Episcopate of
their newly founded Society to Linus</i>.&nbsp; Accordingly, in
strict agreement with this account of the transaction,
Iren&egrave;us places Linus the <span
class="GutSmall">FIRST</span> in his list of the twelve
successive Roman Bishops, who governed that Church, from the time
of its original joint foundation by Peter and Paul, down to the
year 175 when he published his Work against Heresies. <a
name="citation58a"></a><a href="#footnote58a"
class="citation">[58a]</a></p>
<p>Now such an account is plainly incompatible with the pretended
fact: that <i>Peter was the first diocesan Bishop of
Rome</i>.&nbsp; For the account states: that <i>Peter and
Paul</i>, <i>having jointly founded the Roman Churchy committed
the episcopate of it to Linus</i>.&nbsp; Whence it dearly
follows: that the first diocesan Bishop of Rome was <i>Linus</i>,
not <i>Peter</i>.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; The evidence of Iren&egrave;us is directly
confirmed by the ancient author of the Apostolical
Constitutions.</p>
<p>He gives us a list of the primitive apostolically ordained
Bishops: and, in the course of it, he unequivocally states, even
in so many words, that <i>Linus was consecrated the</i> <span
class="GutSmall">FIRST</span> <i>Bishop of the Roman Church</i>;
adding what is not unworthy the attention of the Latin Clergy,
that Linus was so consecrated the <span
class="GutSmall">FIRST</span> Roman Bishop, not by Peter but by
Paul. <a name="citation58b"></a><a href="#footnote58b"
class="citation">[58b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>IV.&nbsp; On the grounds now stated, many persons will
incline to rest, either partially or wholly, in the strongly
expressed judgment of the learned Scaliger.</p>
<p><i>As for the coming of Peter to Rome</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">HIS ROMAN EPISCOPATE OF TWENTY-FIVE
YEARS</span>, <i>and his final martyrdom at Rome</i>, <i>no
man</i>, <i>whose head can boast a grain of common sense</i>,

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">REMARKABLE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS MADE BY THE
ROMISH CLERGY.</span></h2>
<p>So far as respects the <i>evidence</i> upon which stands the
alleged apostolicity of the peculiar doctrines and practices of
Romanism, it will now be useful to hear the various
acknowledgments which have been made by the Latin Clergy
themselves.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Let us begin with that cherished dogma of the Roman
Church, the tenet of Transubstantiation.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; On this point, the theologians of Trent assure us:
that <i>The words of Christ</i>, <i>as recorded by the
Evangelists</i>, <span class="GutSmall">SO PLAINLY AND SO
DISTINCTLY</span> <i>propound the doctrine of
Transubstantiation</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>on the part of wicked and
contentious Protestants</i>, <i>it is both a burning shame and a
crying sin to interpret them figuratively</i>. <a
name="citation59b"></a><a href="#footnote59b"
class="citation">[59b]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Yet the great schoolmen, Johannes Scotus, Biel,
Occam, Peter ab Alliaco Cardinal-Archbishop of Cambray, Cardinal
Cajetan, and Cardinal Fisher of Rochester, have all declared:
that <i>The doctrine of Transubstantiation is</i> <span
class="GutSmall">INCAPABLE OF PROOF</span> <i>from Scripture</i>;
that <i>The doctrine of the bread and wine remaining
substantially unchanged is</i> <span class="GutSmall">LESS
REPUGNANT</span> <i>to Scripture</i>, <i>than the doctrine of
their transubstantiation into the body and blood of Christ</i>;
and, <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>consequently, that <i>The doctrine of
Transubstantiation</i> <span class="GutSmall">CANNOT BE
DEMONSTRATED</span> <i>from the institutive words of Christ</i>,
<i>unless to such words the authoritative decision of the Roman
Church be superadded</i>. <a name="citation60a"></a><a
href="#footnote60a" class="citation">[60a]</a></p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Let us next pass to the dogma of Purgatory.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The divines of Trent profess to have received the
doctrine of Purgatory, both from <i>the declaration of</i> <span
class="GutSmall">SCRIPTURE</span>, and from <i>the ancient
tradition of</i> <span class="GutSmall">THE FATHERS</span>. <a
name="citation60b"></a><a href="#footnote60b"
class="citation">[60b]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Yet Bishop Trevern confesses; that <span
class="smcap">Jesus Christ</span> <i>has not revealed to us the
knowledge of Purgatory</i>: <a name="citation60c"></a><a
href="#footnote60c" class="citation">[60c]</a> Cardinal Fisher
admits; that, <i>Among</i> <span class="smcap">the
Ancients</span>, <i>there was either no mention or very rare
mention of Purgatory</i>, that <i>Purgatory was but lately known
and received by the Catholic Church</i>, and that <i>To this day
the Greeks believe not in its existence</i>. <a
name="citation60d"></a><a href="#footnote60d"
class="citation">[60d]</a>&nbsp; Father Barns tells us; that
<i>Punishment in Purgatory is a doctrine seated in human
opinion</i>, that <i>Neither from</i> <span
class="GutSmall">SCRIPTURE</span> <i>nor from</i> <span
class="GutSmall">THE FATHERS</span> <i>nor from</i> <span
class="GutSmall">THE EARLIER COUNCILS</span> <i>can it be firmly
deduced</i>, and that <i>The contrary opinion seems more
conformable to them</i>: <a name="citation60e"></a><a
href="#footnote60e" class="citation">[60e]</a> and Petrus
Picherellus drily enough remarks; that <i>In</i> <span
class="GutSmall">SCRIPTURE</span> <i>there is no fuel to be
found</i>, <i>either to kindle or to maintain the fire of
Purgatory</i>. <a name="citation60f"></a><a href="#footnote60f"
class="citation">[60f]</a></p>
<p>III.&nbsp; We may next turn our attention to Image-worship and
Saint-worship.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The doctors of the Council of Trent declare: that
<i>According to the use of the Catholic and Apostolic Church</i>
<span class="GutSmall">RECEIVED IN THE PRIMEVAL TIMES OF THE
CHRISTIAN RELIGION</span>, <i>the invocation of dead </i><a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span><i>Saints</i>, <i>the veneration of Relics</i>, <i>and
the kissing and falling down before graven or molten Images</i>,
<i>ought</i>, <i>by the Clergy</i>, <i>to be diligently
inculcated upon the Laity</i>. <a name="citation61a"></a><a
href="#footnote61a" class="citation">[61a]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Yet the learned Jesuit Petavius roundly pronounces it
to be a matter of absolute certainty; that, <span
class="GutSmall">IN THE FIRST AGES OF THE CHURCH</span>,
<i>Images of Christ were not substituted in the place of pagan
Idols nor proposed to the veneration of the faithful</i>: <a
name="citation61b"></a><a href="#footnote61b"
class="citation">[61b]</a> while Cardinal Perron tells us; that
<i>No traces of the practice of invocating the Saints can be
found</i> <span class="GutSmall">IN THE AUTHORS</span>, <span
class="smcap">who lived nearest to the times of the
Apostles</span>. <a name="citation61c"></a><a href="#footnote61c"
class="citation">[61c]</a></p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Let us next advert to the high authority ascribed by
the Romish Clergy to those Councils which are styled
<i>Ecumenical</i> or <i>General</i>.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; These Ecumenical Councils with the Pope at their head
are believed by the Romanists to be, like the Divinity himself
<i>infallible</i> and <i>incapable of error</i>.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Yet the learned Albert Pighius scruples not to
assert: that <i>General Councils are</i>, <i>not of divine</i>,
<i>but of merely human</i>, <i>institution</i>; that <i>They
originate only from a dictate of right reason</i>, <i>because
doubtful matters may be better debated by many than by few</i>,
<i>more especially when the many are prudent and experienced
persons</i>; that <i>In the canonical Scriptures there is not a
word about General Councils</i>, <i>nor from the institution of
the Apostles did the primitive Church of Christ receive any thing
special respecting them</i>: and that <i>From theological grounds
it is impossible to demonstrate that the whole Church ought to be
represented by a General Council</i>. <a
name="citation61d"></a><a href="#footnote61d"
class="citation">[61d]</a></p>
<p>V.&nbsp; Pass we next to the evidence upon which <i>all</i>
the manifold peculiarities of Romanism claim to repose.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>1.&nbsp; The members of the Council of Trent declare:
that, <i>In settling and defining the doctrines and practices of
their Church</i>, <i>they follow the</i> <span
class="GutSmall">UNANIMOUS CONSENT AND TESTIMONY</span> of the
Holy Fathers. <a name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Yet a modern romish doctor, Mr. Husenbeth, has been
driven to confess: that, <i>Although the Latin Clergy</i> <span
class="GutSmall">OUGHT</span> <i>to be able to trace every point
of what he calls Catholic Faith up to the Apostles</i>,
<i>they</i>, <i>in truth</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">CANNOT</span> <i>trace their peculiarities up to
the Apostles</i> <span class="GutSmall">THROUGH THE TESTIMONY OF
THE FATHERS OF THE THREE FIRST CENTURIES</span>. <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a></p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; How persons, who make such acknowledgments, can
still have adhered to the communion of the Church of Rome, I
pretend not to comprehend, and therefore cannot explain.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say: that the acknowledgments <i>have</i> been
made, and that the individuals have nevertheless most
unaccountably maintained and defended their unsubstantiated and
confessedly unsubstantiable peculiarities.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">EXTRAORDINARY THEOLOGICAL PRACTICES OF THE
ROMISH CLERGY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Remarkable</span> as are the
acknowledgments made by the Romish Clergy, their theological
practices will <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>be found not less worthy the attention of the honest and
conscientious inquirer.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The general <span class="GutSmall">PRINCIPLE</span>,
on which these practices are constructed, is very clearly and
distinctly laid down by the Professors of Douay.</p>
<p><i>In managing the old catholic writers when in disputation
opposed to us by our adversaries</i>, say they, <i>we endure very
many errors</i>.&nbsp; <i>Sometimes</i>, <i>we extenuate
them</i>: <i>sometimes</i>, <i>we excuse them</i>: <i>very
frequently</i>, <i>having devised some plausible comment</i>,
<i>we even roundly deny them altogether</i>, <i>affixing to them
some convenient sense</i>. <a name="citation63a"></a><a
href="#footnote63a" class="citation">[63a]</a></p>
<p>II.&nbsp; Such is the avowed <span
class="GutSmall">PRINCIPLE</span> of these ingenious divines,
through the medium of which when reduced to practice, a
troublesome old author, whose claim to catholicity cannot be
quite decently denied, by dint of judicious explaining and
managing and correcting and garbling and interpolating, may be
compelled, either apparently to uphold, or at least not to
contradict, the peculiarities advocated by the Romish Clergy.</p>
<p>Let us now, descending to particulars, mark how the <span
class="GutSmall">PRINCIPLE</span> is reduced to <span
class="GutSmall">PRACTICE</span>.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The first specimen, which I shall give, is that,
afforded by the Douay Doctors themselves, and afterward very
greatly improved upon by the dexterous Bossuet Bishop of
Meaux.</p>
<p>Bertram of Corby, always admitted to be an orthodox catholic
divine, had written, in the ninth century, a book on the
Eucharist; which, in its natural construction, is plainly fatal
to the doctrine of Transubstantiation. <a
name="citation63b"></a><a href="#footnote63b"
class="citation">[63b]</a></p>
<p>Whereupon, the Professors of Douay state; that Bertram&rsquo;s
book, when <i>emendated</i>, may be tolerated: observing with
perfect truth, that, since they had kindly done the good office
of <i>emendation</i> for sundry <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>other ancient catholic writers, no
imaginable reason could be assigned, why Bertram, in all equity,
should not deserve and receive <i>the same diligent
recognition</i>. <a name="citation64a"></a><a href="#footnote64a"
class="citation">[64a]</a></p>
<p>Numerous copies of the Work, however, escaped the ambiguous
benefit of the Douay <i>emendation</i>.&nbsp; Bossuet, therefore,
as in such cases the Professors wisely direct, finally judged it
best to affix to Bertram&rsquo;s undeniable phraseology <i>some
convenient sense</i>.&nbsp; Hence, in settling the merits of the
eucharistic controversy between Paschase and Bertram, the Bishop
of Meaux compendiously assures us: that these two champions, with
their respective followers, were all alike staunch
Transubstantialists, though they unluckily differed as to the
best mode of expressing and propounding their common favourite
doctrine. <a name="citation64b"></a><a href="#footnote64b"
class="citation">[64b]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Another specimen occurs in the remarkable case of
Elfric&rsquo;s Epistle to Wulfstane, written about the close of
the tenth century.</p>
<p>The original Saxon, luckily preserved in the library of Exeter
Cathedral, contains a passage flat against
Transubstantiation.</p>
<p><i>Nevertheless</i>, <i>this sacrifice is</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">NOT</span> <i>the same body of his wherein he
suffered for us</i>, <span class="GutSmall">NOR</span> <i>the
same blood which he shed for us</i>: <i>but</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">SPIRITUALLY</span>, <i>it is made his body and
blood</i>; <span class="GutSmall">AS</span> <i>was that manna
which rained from heaven</i>, <i>and</i> <span
class="GutSmall">AS</span> <i>was that water which did flow out
of the rock</i>. <a name="citation64c"></a><a href="#footnote64c"
class="citation">[64c]</a></p>
<p>Yet, in the Latin translation of the Epistle contained in the
library of Worcester Cathedral, this passage, the decisive
strength of which was evidently felt and tacitly acknowledged,
has been carefully <i>erased</i>. <a name="citation64d"></a><a
href="#footnote64d" class="citation">[64d]</a></p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>3.&nbsp; The treatment of the writings of Theodoret will
afford us yet a third specimen.</p>
<p>This Father, who lived in the fifth century, had expressed
himself so strongly against the doctrine now denominated
<i>Transubstantiation</i>, that John Clement, perceiving the
force of his testimony, and losing his own temper, tore out and
burned the guilty leaf which contained the passage. <a
name="citation65a"></a><a href="#footnote65a"
class="citation">[65a]</a></p>
<p>Now such a summary process might <i>emendate</i> John
Clement&rsquo;s individual copy of Theodoret: but, unluckily,
other copies were abroad in the world.&nbsp; What, then, was to
be done?&nbsp; Why, truly, as the Douay Doctors advise in such
cases, <i>a commodious sense</i>, by dint of <i>excogitating a
comment</i>, must be affixed to the noxious passage.</p>
<p>Theodoret, avowedly opposing the phantasy of
Transubstantiation, had written, concerning the eucharistic bread
and wine <i>after</i> consecration, that <i>they remain in their
former</i> <span class="GutSmall">SUBSTANCE</span> <i>and shape
and appearance</i>. <a name="citation65b"></a><a
href="#footnote65b" class="citation">[65b]</a></p>
<p>But three modern Romish Doctors, Mr. Berington, Bp. Trevern of
Strasbourg, and Mr. Husenbeth, <i>excogitating a more commodious
sense</i> which never occurred to John Clement, make Theodoret
say, in despite both of greek grammar and clear context, that
<i>the</i> consecrated bread and wine <i>remain in the shape and
form of the former</i> <span class="GutSmall">SUBSTANCE</span>.
<a name="citation65c"></a><a href="#footnote65c"
class="citation">[65c]</a></p>
<p>Now this translation, as every schoolboy who reads the
original Greek will at once perceive, is <i>grammatically
impossible</i>.&nbsp; But let that original be withheld from the
gaze of the curious: and ten to one but <i>the commodious
sense</i> will pass muster among the Romish Laity, nay even among
some of the Protestant Laity, without any further difficulty.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>4.&nbsp; A fourth specimen is yet again afforded by the
liberality of the same Bp. Trevern of Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Speaking of a <i>moral</i>, not of a <i>literal</i> or
<i>substantial</i>, change in the consecrated elements, as they
themselves distinctly assure us in the way of explaining their
own language, the old Fathers often say: that <i>the bread and
wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ</i>.</p>
<p>But Bp. Trevern, by deliberately in more than a single
instance <i>interpolating</i> the decisive word <span
class="GutSmall">SUBSTANCE</span>, while from the eyes of his
readers he carefully withholds the originals, makes them speak,
not their own sentiments, but those of the Church and Clergy of
Rome.</p>
<p>Thus, when Cyril of Jerusalem writes; <i>Whatsoever the Holy
Spirit hath touched</i>, <i>that thing is sanctified and
changed</i>: Bp. Trevern forces him to say; <i>All that</i>,
<i>which has received the impression of the Holy Spirit</i>,
<i>is sanctified and changed</i> <span class="GutSmall">INTO
ANOTHER SUBSTANCE</span>. <a name="citation66a"></a><a
href="#footnote66a" class="citation">[66a]</a></p>
<p>And thus, when the old author of the Treatise on the
Sacraments in the Works of Ambrose writes; <i>They are changed
into other</i>: Bp. Trevern remorselessly compels him to say;
<i>They pass into another</i> <span
class="GutSmall">SUBSTANCE</span>. <a name="citation66b"></a><a
href="#footnote66b" class="citation">[66b]</a></p>
<p>5.&nbsp; For our fifth specimen we are indebted jointly to Bp.
Trevern and Mr. Berington.</p>
<p>Cyprian speaks of men being <i>cleansed for sins through the
suffering of long pain</i> and of their being <i>long purged in
fire</i>. <a name="citation66c"></a><a href="#footnote66c"
class="citation">[66c]</a></p>
<p>These expressions, as the whole context shews and as it was
rightly observed by the honest romish commentator Rigaltius,
relate simply to the allegorical fire of penitential austerities
in <i>this</i> world: a fire, in which, by the early discipline
of the Church, it was <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>required, that the lapsed should for
an appointed season be exercised.</p>
<p>But Bp. Trevern and Mr. Berington, wholly <i>suppressing</i>
the context and <i>saying not a single syllable</i> about their
respectable fellow-religionist Rigaltius, gravely adduce the
passage as proof positive: that <i>Cyprian</i>, <i>in the middle
of the third century</i>, <i>held and taught the existence of a
Purgatory after death in the next world</i>. <a
name="citation67"></a><a href="#footnote67"
class="citation">[67]</a></p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Our sixth specimen is afforded by Mr. Husenbeth.</p>
<p>The famous text in the Gospel of St. Matthew, which exhibits
our Lord as saying, <i>Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will
build my Church</i>, is universally explained by the Romish
Clergy, as being <i>a grant from Christ of a monarchal supremacy
in the Catholic Church</i>, <i>both to Peter individually</i>,
<i>and to Peter&rsquo;s alleged heirs and successors the Bishops
of Rome</i>.</p>
<p>Now, most unluckily for this current explanation, the
primitive theologians knew nothing of it: for, while the early
Fathers, Justin and Tertullian and Cyprian and Origen and
Athanasius and Jerome and Augustine and Chrysostom and Hilary,
differ as to the true meaning of the text (some supposing the
rock to be Peter personally and exclusively; some, to be Christ
himself; and some, to be Peter&rsquo;s confession of
Christ&rsquo;s divinity); <span class="GutSmall">NOT ONE</span>
of them interprets it, as the Romish Clergy would now interpret
it.</p>
<p>Yet, by way of putting to open shame every opponent of the
Pope&rsquo;s supremacy by divine right, Mr. Husenbeth
deliberately assures his plain country readers: that, <i>by</i>
<span class="GutSmall">ALL</span> <i>the holy Fathers and
Doctors</i>, <i>by</i> <span class="GutSmall">ALL</span> <i>the
Councils</i>, <i>and by the most learned and pious men in the
world in</i> <span class="GutSmall">EVERY</span> <i>age down to
the Reformation</i>, <i>the text in question has been</i> <span
class="GutSmall">UNIFORMLY</span> <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span><i>understood as it is now explained
by the Romish Clergy</i>. <a name="citation68a"></a><a
href="#footnote68a" class="citation">[68a]</a></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; The copiousness of Mr. Husenbeth will afford us also
yet a seventh specimen.</p>
<p>With every semblance of even scrupulous fidelity, giving
distinct references to his authorities, this theologian, in a
small Work written for circulation among <i>the unlearned</i>,
declares; that <i>Papias</i>, <i>Ignatius</i>,
<i>Iren&egrave;us</i>, <i>Dionysius of Corinth</i>, <i>Caius of
Rome</i>, <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>, <i>Tertullian</i>,
<i>Origen</i>, <i>and Cyprian</i>, <i>all with one voice
explicitly assert St. Peter to have been the first diocesan
Bishop of Rome</i>: and he adds, still for the information of
<i>the unlearned</i>; that <i>Mr. White</i>, who had
unceremoniously pronounced St. Peter&rsquo;s Roman Episcopate to
be an idle and ungrounded report, <i>did but attempt to impose
upon such humble readers as have no means of examining
history</i>, <i>by such worn out fallacies and vile
fabrications</i>. <a name="citation68b"></a><a
href="#footnote68b" class="citation">[68b]</a></p>
<p>Yet I have myself examined all Mr. Husenbeth&rsquo;s
references to his above alleged witnesses from the three first
centuries: and I can positively state, from the testimony of my
own eye-sight, that <span class="GutSmall">NOT ONE</span> <i>of
those witnesses says a single syllable</i>, <i>as to St. Peter
having been the first diocesan Bishop of Rome</i>, <i>or indeed
as to his</i> <span class="GutSmall">EVER</span> <i>having been
Bishop of that See</i>.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Our eighth specimen is furnished by the joint
industry and rival intrepidity of Bp. Trevern and Mr.
Husenbeth.</p>
<p>For the purpose of persuading the unwary, that <i>the highest
divine adoration of the consecrated bread and wine had been the
practice of the Church from the earliest ages</i>, Bp. Trevern
adduces a direction or rubric from the ancient Clementine
Liturgy: and, <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>after him, Mr. Husenbeth eagerly catches up, for the
same purpose, the same ancient rubric or direction. <a
name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a"
class="citation">[69a]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile the direction itself, in its <i>genuine</i> state
says not a syllable respecting <i>any</i> adoration of the
consecrated bread and wine.&nbsp; Bp. Trevern first
<i>interpolates</i> it, to make it serve his purpose: and then
Mr. Husenbeth brings forward, <i>as evidence</i>, the precise
words of the gallican prelates <i>interpolation</i> wedged into
an utterly false construction of the original passage. <a
name="citation69b"></a><a href="#footnote69b"
class="citation">[69b]</a></p>
<p>9.&nbsp; Our ninth and last specimen is of a somewhat
wholesale nature: whence it will the more completely exemplify
the <span class="GutSmall">PRINCIPLE</span>, laid down, for the
better furtherance of truth, by the painful Professors of
Douay.</p>
<p>The King of Spain (I avail myself of the diligent researches
of our own excellent Bishop Jeremy Taylor) gave a commission to
the Inquisitors, to <i>purge</i> all catholic authors: but with
this special clause; that <i>they should keep private among
themselves the expurgatory index</i>, <i>neither communicating it
to otters</i>, <i>nor giving a copy of it to any one</i>.</p>
<p>It happened, however, by the Divine Providence so ordering it,
that, about thirteen years after, a copy of it was procured and
published by Johannes Pappus and Franciscus Junius.&nbsp; This
circumstance compelled the Inquisitors to acknowledge their
expurgatory index: and they have since printed it themselves.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; Let us now observe some few of the exploits of
<i>emendation</i>, achieved by these honest and laborious
correctors of erring Antiquity.</p>
<p>In Chrysostom&rsquo;s Works printed at Basil, the words,
<i>There is no merit</i>, <i>but what is given us by Christ</i>,
are commanded to be expunged.&nbsp; Yet these very <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>words occur
in his first Homily upon the text of St. John, <i>Ye are my
friends</i>.</p>
<p>A similar erasure is enjoined of the clause, <i>The Church is
built</i>, <i>not upon the man</i>, <i>but upon the
faith</i>.&nbsp; Yet this clause occurs in his Sermonon
Pentecost.</p>
<p>The same <i>expurgatory process</i> has been undergone by
Chrysostom in many other places: and Ambrose and Augustine and
the rest of the old Fathers have been subjected to the like
necessary <i>emendations</i>.</p>
<p>In short the <i>curtailments</i> of the ancient writers were
carried to so great an extent, that Ludovicus Saurius, the
corrector of the press at Lyons, shewed and complained of them to
Junius: lamenting, that he was forced to cancel and erase many
sayings of Ambrose in that edition of his Works which was printed
at Lyons in the year 1559.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; Not content with thus <i>emendating</i> the
Fathers, our pains-taking Inquisitors, in order that their
editions might throughout be perfectly harmonious and consistent,
fell doggedly to work upon the very tables or indexes, which
contained any references to the expunged passages: for, of
course, it were unseemly, that a reference should appear,
indicating the occurrence of a place which <i>itself</i> could no
where be found in an improved or expurgated edition.</p>
<p>Thus, out of one of Froben&rsquo;s indexes, they have directed
the erasure of the following references: <i>The use of images
forbidden</i>; <i>The Eucharist no sacrifice</i>, <i>but the
commemoration of a sacrifice</i>; <i>Works</i>, <i>although they
do not justify</i>, <i>yet are necessary to salvation</i>;
<i>Marriage is granted to all that will not contain</i>;
<i>Venial sins damn</i>; <i>The dead Saints</i>, <i>after this
life</i>, <i>cannot help us</i>.</p>
<p>And thus, out of the index of Augustine&rsquo;s Works by
Claudius Chevallonius at Paris in the year 1531, they have
commanded a still more extraordinary erasure of a reference:
<i>Dele</i>, <i>Solus Deus adorandus</i>; <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>that is,
<i>Blot out the words</i>, <i>God alone is to be adored</i>. <a
name="citation71a"></a><a href="#footnote71a"
class="citation">[71a]</a></p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; On such disgraceful practices, Bp. Taylor well
remarks: <i>These instances may serve</i>, <i>instead of
multitudes which might be brought</i>, <i>of their corrupting the
witnesses and razing the records of antiquity</i>, <i>that the
errors and novelties of the Church of Rome might not be so easily
reproved</i>.&nbsp; <i>Now</i>, <i>if the Fathers were not
against them</i>, <i>what need these arts</i>?&nbsp; <i>Why
should they use them thus</i>?&nbsp; <i>Their own expurgatory
indices me infinite testimony against them</i>, <i>both that they
do so</i>, <i>and that they need it</i>. <a
name="citation71b"></a><a href="#footnote71b"
class="citation">[71b]</a></p>
<p>III.&nbsp; It were easy to have multiplied specimens of the
same description: but these, I apprehend, may well suffice.</p>
<p>Respecting such a topic, any observations of my own are quite
superfluous.&nbsp; By some marvellous perversion of the moral
sense, Sixtus Senensis, indeed, has even <i>lauded</i> Pope Pius
V, because he had taken diligent care, that the writings of all
catholic authors, and more especially the writings of the ancient
Fathers, should be <i>expurgated and emaculated</i>: but the
plain good sense of every upright and honourable man will deem
such praise no very flattering compliment. <a
name="citation71c"></a><a href="#footnote71c"
class="citation">[71c]</a></p>
<p>Yet, though I shall not weary the prudent inquirer with any
needless remarks of my own, either on the Douay Principle itself,
or on the reduction of that principle to systematic practice: I
may, at parting, be permitted, in all good will, to offer him a
word of not altogether useless advice.</p>
<p>Whenever a Romish Doctor makes a large or extraordinary or
startling assertion, there clearly can be <i>no harm</i> in <span
class="GutSmall">A CAUTIOUS SUSPENSION OF BELIEF</span>, until <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>either the
enquirer himself or some competent and trust-worthy friend shall
have had an opportunity of <span class="GutSmall">ACTUAL AND
PERSONAL VERIFICATION OF ALLEGED AUTHORITIES</span>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the close of this brief manual,
it may perhaps be useful to state the question as it now presents
itself.</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; Upon those who <i>assert</i>, rests the duty and
incumbency of <i>proof</i>.&nbsp; Yet, in regard to what by a
single comprehensive word may be styled <i>Popery</i>, the
question stands <i>negatively</i>, in manner following.</p>
<p><i>The peculiar doctrines and practices</i>, <i>which the
Clergy of the Roman Church pertinaciously inculcate upon their
Laity</i>, <i>and to which they would proselyte the unthinking
and uninformed Protestant</i>, <span class="GutSmall">CAN NOT BE
TRACED UP TO CHRIST AND HIS INSPIRED APOSTLES</span>, <i>either
by the evidence of God&rsquo;s Written Word</i>, <i>or by the
subordinate testimony of the successive ecclesiastical writers of
the three first centuries</i>.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; But this circumstance, bad enough even in itself, is
by no means the worst part of the matter.</p>
<p><i>Scripture and the early Fathers</i>, <i>not only</i>,
<i>negatively</i>, <span class="GutSmall">DO NOT ESTABLISH</span>
<i>the apostolicity of the peculiarities of Popery</i>: <i>but
they also</i>, <i>positively</i>, <span
class="GutSmall">CONTRADICT AND CONDEMN</span> <i>those same
peculiarities</i>.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; Hence, if I mistake not, the sober inquirer, who
demands <i>proof</i> instead of <i>assertion</i>, will at length
find himself irresistibly brought to the following very important
conclusion.</p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">IN ADMITTING THE PECULIARITIES OF THE
LATIN CHURCH AS ARTICLES OF THE CHRISTIAN REVELATION</span>,
<span class="GutSmall">THE ROMANIST BELIEVES</span>, <span
class="GutSmall">NOT ONLY WITHOUT EVIDENCE</span>, <span
class="GutSmall">BUT EVEN AGAINST EVIDENCE</span>.</p>

<p><i>We have</i> <span class="GutSmall">A DOCTRINAL
SYSTEM</span> <i>professedly resting upon</i> <span
class="GutSmall">A BASIS OF ASSERTED FACTS</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="GutSmall">DOCTRINAL SYSTEM</span> comprehends
<i>all the peculiarities of Popery</i>: the <span
class="GutSmall">BASIS OF ASSERTED FACTS</span> is <i>the
unanimous teaching of those peculiarities both by Holy Scripture
and by the whole body of the Fathers</i>.</p>
<p>Now, if, <i>simply as an historical matter of fact</i>, the
peculiarities of Popery be <i>not</i> taught by Holy Scripture,
and by the whole body of the Fathers, will Dr. Norris and Dr.
Doyle have the goodness to tell us; how, on the declared
principles of the Council of Trent, we are to estimate the
<i>value</i> of those same peculiarities?</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
